    "review_text": "My husband loves coconut water. We were ordering via \"subscribe and save\" the boxes of Zico, but when we saw the bottles of Zico in the store, he wanted to switch because he wanted a larger quantity at one time - he takes them to work and all of his games. He mentioned that it tasted different, but we didn't think much of it. Then, I noticed the \"from concentrate\" after looking at a bottle in the fridge. We are not paying \"top dollar\" for imitation coconut water and the explanation on their website was ridiculous. It is like can OJ! After doing my research on their website, I was angry that they switched the \"liquid\" going into the box vs. bottle. Never again! I immediately canceled our \"subscribe and save\" order. We our going to Henry's this week to purchase a variety of coconut waters and will \"subscribe and save\" to another brand that uses the real stuff!",

First, is that this now comes in a plastic bottle and is from concentrate, with the added ingredient of \"natural flavors\", whatever those may be. I don't know how to put it into words, but it just lacks vitality and freshness that should be in coconut water. It taste nothing like their previous product which comes in the paper Tetra-Pak cartons: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CN7BMA\">ZICO Pure Premium Coconut Water, Natural, 11.2-Ounce Tetra Paks (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />These may be cost-cutting moves and they show.

    "review_title": "Bummer: My fave packaged coconut water is RUINED!",
    "review_text": "Note: Please carefully review the NEGATIVE reviews before purchasing, as a Zico sales manager and probably others have been affecting the ratings/reviews/comments here due to original Zico drinkers posting critical reviews about this inferior new product that's nowhere near as good as original Zico. Be forewarned.<br /><br />~I've been drinking Zico for a couple years, getting my fix via amazon subscription. I and my sisters loved this stuff so much, I used to regularly order my shipments EARLY, and multiple cases at that.<br /><br />Well, that's it. They have officially lost me as a customer. After waiting impatiently for them to be back in stock in the natural (I hate the flavored ones), I just got the three cases I ordered.<br /><br />Oh, my goodness. I have three cases of this horror! I can't drink this!<br /><br />I don't know why they had to mess with a successful and deliciously refreshing beverage. I grew up drinking fresh coconut water (my family hails from the Caribbean), so I am well accustomed to the natural and subtle yumminess of coconut water. A chilled Zico used to be as close as I could get to the treat that is sipping from a straw right out of the chilled coconut that's had it's top sliced open for you on the spot (and it gets harder to find that in Metro Miami, but you still can).<br /><br />Now, it's not fit to drink. It smells funny. It tastes strange. The best I can describe it is that it reminds me of a watered-down version of the remainder-milk at the bottom of a bowl of Corn Pops when I was a kid--less sweet, more watery, but like that, with a chemically edge and a stale smell.<br /><br />How messed up is this?<br /><br />I can't believe someone gave this bottled version 5 stars! That's crazy. The OLD Zico deserved 5 stars. Not this. I hope those yoga places stop carrying it and tell Zico to bring back the fresh stuff. This sucks. I guess I better start mixing up these 35 bottles of zombie Zico with pomegranate juice or Acai Splash or something to cover up the taste and still benefit from the electrolytes. Hm.  I suspect there will be an upswing in sales for O.N.E. and VitaCoco and other brands in the old packaging. I've tried both of those (still have some ONE in the fridge from my order while I waited for Zico). Both were inferior to Old Zico. Both are preferable to New Zico.<br /><br />And someone please hand the president of Zico a bottle of this and ask hm if he REALLY thinks this is the taste of the stuff that made so many rabid fans, like I USED TO BE: past tense.<br /><br />Hey, Mr. Zico CEO, give me back my money!!!! You sold me rubbish!<br /><br />Okay, I ranted and got that off my chest. I do think having a recyclable bottle is great. The bottle feels good in the hand and makes it easy to add flavorings for those who prefer that. Easier to carry around. And I strongly suspect that those who are new to coconut water won't realize this has declined in flavor, so it's possible it can sell huge among the new initiates to the health benefits of coconut water.<br /><br />But I still miss old Zico.<br /><br />Note: I'm updating cause I found if I let the bottle sit with the cap off or  pour out into a glass, the funny smell dissipates and it's more drinkable. HTH.<br /><br />Update: Found a great replacement. Ordered Organic coconut water from amazon, brand Nature Factor. It's lovely. Lovely! So, at least I've found a happy replacement. Worth a try for those on the lookout for another tasty coconut water now that Zico sucks. Addendum: Found out that this brand uses very high heat to pasteurize and it may be nutrient compromised. If you mostly care about flavor, this one is great. If you are concerned about high heat, prolonged pasteurization, skip this one. HTH.<br /><br />2nd Update: I received a reply to an email I sent to Zico via their website. I was told that new Zico in the bottle tastes \"just like\" young Thai coconut water. That it's different from Brazilian c.w. and so takes getting used to. Hm. Well, I've had unprocessed/raw young Thai coconut water. I don't recall it making me wanna spit it out. :) Just sayin'.<br /><br />3rd Update: Saw a couple online taste tests that gave props to Amy & Brian, also available here on amazon,  so will be trying that, too, now that I'm coconut water peregrinating. Might be worth a shot to google up coconut water taste tests and see what might suit you if you aren't anti-can. ADDENDUM: Tried it, loved the first batch in the 17.5 oz cans. I emailed the company and it's just CW (not from concentrate) and it's FLASH Pasteurized, so the nutrient count should be comparable to other coconut waters in the tetra paks (though A&B will likely show a higher carb/calorie count due to its sweetness). If you're carb-counting, you may wanna compare. If your main concern is \"natural\" and tasty-sweet, then consider Amy & Brian's. Really nice. Warning: Ordered a second batch in the 10 oz cans, and it tasted odd. Candy-sweet, like candy that melted in water. So, I can no longer recommend this brand due to flavor inconsistencies on that scale. Pity, as my first order was AMAZING. boohoo<br /><br />4th Update: Old Zico from Brazilian coconuts will be back in September. If you liked old Zico, WAIT, don't buy this one. Also, in a letter from the Zico Sales Director to a reviewer here (see discussion for details), the Zico rep said they'd increased sodium in this bottled Asian CW Zico to \"optimize\" hydration benefits. So, it's not just that it's from concentrate, it's \"optimized\" to make it saltier. By optimized, I don't mean they ADDED sodium, but used a mix of coconuts to \"optimize.\" (Note: I know this cause the sales manager of Zico, Sherif P. Bates, replied to a discussion with a clarification, and this comment was posted under his own review post here. See discussion of comments under \"Todd O'Connor\". ) I don't know about y'all, but part of the reason why I like CW is that it's great to keep highish blood pressure normal due to its high Potassium. I do not need--and most Americans don't need--more sodium in their beverages or food. Maybe elite athletes sweating up a storm do, but not the rest of us who just exercise moderately (or not at all). So, there you go: New Zico. More sodium, less flavor.<br /><br />Note about reviews: Do check the reviewer's profile. If a reviewer is five-star (or four-star, even) raving about this product and has only reviews for Zico products and has no verified amazon purchase, find a grain of salt to toy with. That's no guarantee, naturally, but sometimes is a clue to...well, you can guess. (Note: See comments under the review by \"Todd O'Connor\" and under Alio \"Alio\"s review for an explanation of how I learned about ONE fake review and Alio \"Alio\" confirming the fake identity.)",

    "review_text": "So the first time that I had coconut water was in college.  It all started with a cold tetra pack of vita coco and I have been hooked ever since.  Vita coco is clearly a superior product as it is 100% with no concentrates; although, Zico I would put on the same scale.  It does not taste like 100% coconut water nor does it taste like plastic.  It tastes like coconut water from concentrate and I do not mean that in  a bad way.  You just have to take risks in life, check out a case when they are on sale (around $11) and give this product a try!  It is a little different but the change is nice!",

We usually drink them in the morning for breakfast to jump start our day & sometimes after dinner to satisfy our sweet tooth.  I can't wait to tell my friends and family about them!

I also like O.N.E; vita coco isn't bad either.  I figured that if I like zico in the 11oz carton, why not order the 14oz bottle?  Big mistake... unlike the product in the 11oz carton, this bottled stuff absolutely misrepresents authentic coconut water.  It has an after taste like sour milk.  I've tasted spoiled coconut water before in the caribbean, and even that tastes better than the new zico.  I have never felt so compelled to write a review about a product before.  I hope zico stops making their \"new\" product from concentrate, and gets back to what made their coconut water such a wonderful product in the first place.  Hope you don't make the same mistake that I did.",

At trader joes, Zico costs about 2 bucks, which is the same price for C20 coconut water and Vitacoco which both do NOT have \"natural flavors\" added to it and are NOT from concentrate. The packaging advertises \"30 percent less sugar\"...well that's because they took out 30% of the coconut water and replaced it with water. It was so nasty that they had to add \"natural flavors\". Do not buy this brand. When I was a little kid I used to suck on my water squirt guns and the taste of this coconut water resembles that-like plastic/water with a small hint of coconut water. The other brands are so much better and are actually natural. For the same price, go get a coconut water that is not from concentrate. My favorite is C20.",

    "review_text": "I've never been a big \"health nut\" and but when a \"health nut\" friend of mine had me try a Zico coconut water drink (plain) I was under the continued opinion that stuff that's \"healthy\" for us isn't healthy for the tongue (i.e. taste).  It wasn't until I was at the local supermarket and tried the Zico Chocolate Coconut Water and fell in love with my first \"health drink\".<br /><br />I would strongly recommend that you try this great drink before supplies run out!  It's a very popular drink and according to the agriculture website coconuts are becoming harder to get because of the broadened use of coconut water and milk.  So as I said TRY it before they run out.",

I did hesitate b/c I read many of the reviews and some people received bad batches (if I were this person, I would have definately contacted the company)- however my batch was good!

It tastes like coconut water to me with a slight extra taste of mango. Well, I'm not particularly interested in the mango taste, it's the ingredient mix in the water that is of interest. The mango taste just makes it a bit more tasty to someone who is not used to coconut water. And, except for the slight flavoring this is pure coconut water. Nothing else. I used to be a marathoner and we used to look for things like this. It's the mix of electrolytes that's important and this drink is impressive. It would be very good for relief of cramps and restoring lost body fluids when you pour out a lot of sweat. I wish I'd had it in my marathoning days.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",

    "review_text": "I was never a really big fan of ZICO natural before ... until the bottle came out. Honestly, I absolutely LOVE, LOVE the nuttier flavor and can't drink enough of it. It's significanlty more drinkable for someone who's never had coconut water a part of their daily diet.  The original flavors are great, Mango and Passion. I first fell in love with ZICO by drinking the Passion, then I started to wanting less flavor and transitioned to Mango. But never full latched onto natural. Though, I've been wanting to make the switch.<br /><br />With the bottle now, it's what I've been waiting for. I LOVE IT!!! It's amazing to just chug it cold after a hard work out, and you know it's packed with natural electrolytes, potassium, and so much more. Great for your skin and internal system. Overall it's just an amazing beverage. I can't stop raving about it to all my friends, family, and fellow athletes. Currently, I'm training for an aquathon, and I don't know how I did it before. But there's no going back now.<br /><br />My other favorite in the bottle is Lima Citron. It's so tasty. It just brings me back to my childhood since the smell reminds me of Fruit Loops! And it taste just as yummy, but sooo much better for you.<br /><br />Look I'll be honest. The bottle isn't tetra, and it's not meant to be. Tetra is great in it's own right, but this new line has proposed another fabulous alternative to all those who love coconut water but needed more versility with the on-go lifestyle. So credit is due for that.<br /><br />I'm super stoked that ZICO gave us consumers two options: tetra and bottle. And I'm going to enjoy both fully!! It's just wonderful to switch up the flavors. Somedays I'll have Natural others Mango. When I'm training, it'll be the bottle. At the office, it'll be the tetra. Any way you look at it, ZICO is helping me be healthier whether it's in the bottle or tetra.  It's just a personal preference at this point. So try it and be your own judge.<br /><br />Besides when I found out that the bottle is actually more environmentally friendly, I was happily surprised. Tetra isn't recylced by many plants nationally. 30% of the bottle is made from recylced materials and is 100% recylcable(including the cap - unlike water bottles). Personally, this is important to me.<br /><br />And I agree with the other reviewers with regards to the concentrate and the decrease of their carbon foot print. It's true and relevant.<br /><br />ZICO, thank you for the amazing products you continue to give to us, and most importantly thank you for promoting a healthier, more hydrated lifestyle in a fabulously tasty way via bottle or tetra. Here's to you in breaking the mold and trying to help more people with your new bottle while still keeping tetra for those who've become so loyal. Hat's off!!! You've now acquired another fan for life!!!<br /><br />Cheers!!!!<br /><br />P.S. ZICO is still amazing.",

It was interesting to me that, what with the free shipping, this was more than a dollar a bottle cheaper than I buy it for in the grocery store.  It came double boxed.  That is, there was a compartmentalized container with the liter bottles carefully packed within, this box was surrounded by air bag packaging and packed within a larger sturdy cardboard container.  Great packaging.<br />  My wife uses this product and her comments follow:  As to the taste.  I found I prefer Zico over the other brands as it doesn't appear to have any \"hidden\" sugar added to hype up the taste.  My previous brand, Vita Coco,  did not declare added sugar, but it did leave that sugared drink after taste in my mouth and was noticeably sweeter.<br />  I cannot say that I particularly like the taste of coconut water, but it has the nutritional potassium I need in my diet, and is easier to keep around than bananas and has less calories.",

At first, I was disappointed; the first taste seemed rather bland (and it was somewhat warm).  The next day, I drank another carton (cold now) and it wasn't too bad.  The third day I found myself looking forward to getting home to drink a carton of this stuff!  Now, I love it so much I've subscribed to regular deliveries.  For me, the mango flavor is the best.

    "review_text": "I got the medium/large size about 2 weeks ago for my 2 year old, 40lb dog. He is a generally smart dog so I was a little disappointed when for the first several days all he would do was lick where the rope went into the toy in hopes of getting the food out. Now, a week or so later he is knocking it all around and seems to have really gotten a hang of it. All of his food fits into the toy, (about a cup) and I am sure more would fit for a larger dog. I think now that he has figured it out I may start putting his meals into it so he doesn't eat too much.<br /><br />This is one of the original reasons why I bought this toy, because he bolts down his food and bloat was a concern. Plus it will give him something to do when I am away at work. On the quality of the material, I would say the plastic bottle is very  hard and seems tough enough to handle being  whacked around against the floor and walls. I cannot give an accurate account, however, because my dog has not shown any interest in chewing this toy. The ball at the end of the neck is a softer plastic, and I think that if he wanted to he could chew it up, but again he is mainly focused on the food aspect, not necessarily chewing up the toy itself.<br /><br /> I would say give your dog some time to figure out the toy and don't be surprised if it takes a week or so to figure out, because now that he has he is always pushing it around the floor.",

    "review_text": "I accidentally bought the large Tug-a-Jug for my little 12 lb Maltese/Jack Russell mix dog. Although it intimidated her as a puppy, she has since come to love this toy and begs to be able to play with it. (I wouldn't suggest small dog owners getting the large toy for their small dogs though. It works for Izzy, but my parents toy poodle won't do much more than sniff at it.)<br /><br />DURABILITY: My main concern with buying toys for Izzy is she can destroy most things in a short amount of time. Toys for \"aggressive chewers\" last a couple hours tops, and the only way I get stuffed squeaker toys is purely for her occasional entertainment. The Tug-a-Jug, however, has not been a problem whatsoever; it's still in great condition, and she's been playing with it for a year.<br /><br />TREATS: I would suggest when they're learning how it works, to fill it with treats like Premier Buddy Berries Dog Treats. They're a training treat and very small. Once your dog figures out how to work the treats out, fill it with something like Zuke's 16-Ounce Mini Bakes Dog Treats. These are larger and create a bigger challenge. Also, of course, dog food works great too.<br /><br />This is a great toy and option for dogs that have energy and enjoy a challenge. It's also entertaining to watch them try to get the treats out :)",

    "review_text": "I bought one of these last year for my pittie mix who was less than a year old, he LOVED it at first and had a great time throwing, kicking and rolling it all over the floor to get to the treats.  Then he started holding the jug down with his paws and puling up on the \"rope,\" which didn't take long to tear in half.  I thought maybe he could still use it but that the treat would come out easier, this was not a good idea.  He started chewing on the rubber at the top of the jug and it came apart in pieces - thank goodness he didn't swallow any!  So I figured once again that maybe it would still be useful once I removed the rest of the rubber bits that were torn, again I was wrong.  He started to chew on the top of the jug itself (can't blame him it did smell like treats!) and the plastic quickly became jagged and sharp.  In less than 24 hours this toy was in pieces and in the trash.  It was definitely NOT worth the almost $20 I spent on it!",

The jug keeps him occupied for anywhere between 25 minutes to an hour.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Good mental stimulation. Dinner isn't just available to wolf down. It requires some work and is totally worth the reward!<br />2. Sturdy construction. It's held up against the chewy habit of the pup. I do not let him chew on it outside of meal times in order to keep his focus mainly on the food and not the jug.<br />3. The rope seems to be very enjoyable to our pup. He likes to stop and chew on it for a minute before starting to roll and spin the jug again. I'm guessing that has something to do with teething. It's also replaceable (if you can find replacement rope).<br />4. Easy to clean. The bottom screws on/off and the inside can be wiped down.<br />5. Mouth of the jug has a nice texture which helps our pup hold on with his paws. His spin and push control (with his paws) has increased drastically since we started feeding him one meal a day from it!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Sturdy construction also means it breaks anything fragile in its path. The rope makes it easy to swing around. I would keep the dog and jug away from small pets and children.<br />2. Can't use it with raw food unless you want to make a horrible mess all over the place.<br />3. Loud if you keep it on a linoleum floor like we do. Our pup loves to bang the jug around, spin it with his paws and push it with his nose. It makes quite a racket. It's fairly quiet on the carpet.<br />4. If your dog is really smart, he might figure this one out quickly. I'd recommend pairing this with one of the other Busy Buddy feeding products and switching between them often to keep your dog on his toes.",

    "review_text": "My small, 6 lb Mini Schnauzer-Shih Tzu mix found this a bit frustrating.  As others have said in the reviews, she couldn't get the treats out...she knew they were in there, but they don't come out easily and I put in her smallest doggie food.  Heck, I couldn't even get them out unless I pulled VERY hard on the rope.  She likes the rope, but not for long...she'd like it better by itself.  I got the smallest one and she's a very smart dog, but it's just not for her.  Don't know what I'm going to do with this thing...just put it in her toy box I guess and hope she latches onto it once in a while.  It's a total waste of money in my opinion.  She likes the roller treat dispensers...I even made one myself with an empty plastic peanut jar, used an exacto knife to cut holes on two sides, and she can roll it around and get excited about her treats rolling out...even an empty butter tub can be used.  Save you money on this one.  Just MHO.<br />Update:  My puppy is now 11 pounds, full grown and will be 1 year soon and STILL cannot get the treats out of this thing.  I even have a hard time getting them out....I have to pull the rope HARD to get anything out.  Then I noticed my pup chewing on it and she was chewing the bottom off and, by the time I noticed what she was doing, she had it off.  She GOT the treats, but I threw the thing away....total waste of money I think.  Not MHO this time....experience!!",

I came across this while searching for dog toys, and loved the idea that it is not only a toy, but a reward/education system.  After filling it with some of his favorite treats (cheerios), i put it on the ground and awaited his reaction.  He was a bit confused at first, but after pushing it and dragging it I think he finally realized how the toy will reward him with play.  Took him a solid hour to go through a handful of treats, and he seemed VERY engaged.  Didn't even notice me cooking in the kitchen (he usually follows and stares and waits for food to fall).",

He still hasn't figured out how to get the food out, but it keeps him occupied for a couple of hours as he tries to figure out how to get it.  Most of the time he chews on the rope.  He has a strong bite and so far the rope is still holding on strong -- this is also why I bought him the medium/large. I felt that if I got him a small he'd chew the rope right off.<br /><br />The only con is that the toy is a little big for him to carry sometimes, and I didn't realize that the plastic bottle was going to be as hard as it is so it makes loud annoying sounds when it drops on the tile and hard wood when he tries to carry it on top of the sofa or bed. So other than the loud banging noises, I'd say this is a good toy. Highly recommend if you have carpet.",

    "review_text": "My dog loves tug-a-war with ropes and etc so I thought this would be a great toy for her, since she is left alone during the day while I'm at work.  The problem is that she tugs on the rope, then smells the treats inside, then won't mess with the rope at all and instead spends her time sniffing at the \"scent holes\" and from the neck of the bottle.  She will try to stick her tongue into the neck of the bottle.  I've demonstrated to her over and over that pulling on the rope dispenses a treat, but she just refuses to pull on the rope, even when I hold onto the bottle end and try to get her to play tug-a-war.  She smells the treat and doesn't want to play, she wants the treat, and she doesn't understand it.  I even took AKC liver treats and cut them into 1/4 and liberally filled the bottom of the jar with them, so that even a mild tug on the rope would result in a piece of treat being released.  She just has no interest in pulling on the rope at all.  She will mess with it for a few minutes and when she can't get the treats out, she leaves it alone.  I was pretty disappointed with it.  I think it would help if they made the outside knot smaller so you could pass the rope through the back of the bottle.  That way you I could get my dog to just play with the rope without worrying about the treats and try putting it back in the bottle once she got used to it.  As is, I've had it a month and she doesn't get, so I'm considering cutting the knot off the end so she can at least play with the bottle and dump the treats out, and play with whats left of the rope seperately.",

This Tug-a-jug is larger than our last; it is the Medium/Large size. Toby enjoys trying to get whatever I put into it and puts a lot of thought into it. He even prefers having his regular food out of it, even though he could simply go to his bowl to eat. The bottom easily screws off, I fill it with his food, a few treats of varying value and one extremely high value treat (EHVT) that really doesn't come out, but he has hope that some day it will. When I wash it, he gets the contents and thus the EHVT. He knows that I unscrew the bottom, but of course without opposable thumbs, alas he can not. Even so, he tries to figure out how to do that. Dogs can use a lot of energy thinking, chewing and exercising, so I like to give him a variety of each to keep him content. Our last Tug-a-jug being smaller, he would pick it up from the bottom to try to get the food out, this one being bigger, he can no longer do that, so he's had to change his tactics and I've enjoyed watching how his mind works.",

    "review_text": "I bought this product to occupy my 13-month-old mix.  She is an aggressive chewer, but the product description led me to believe that this toy was quite tough.  When I received it, I was a little disheartened when I saw that the tug was rubber, rather than rope (as it appears in the picture)- as she tends to get through rubber toys with very little effort.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I decided to try it out, she learned quickly that she could get treats out of it and it occupied her very well for almost an hour.  At that point I went to dig it out from under the bed and was dismayed to find that the rubber \"pull\" was already in pieces.  While the bottle still works and seems to keep her interested, I feel like dog toys should have a more indestructible nature than this one does.  Especially for eleven dollars!",

    "review_text": "My boston loves this toy!  It keeps her busy for quite a while and she's a heavy chewer, so it held up... for a while.  Like others, she has managed to chew her way through the rubber rope that comes out the end, but only a little at a time.  I keep a good eye on it and when it looks like she's about to get another piece off, I just cut that little bit off with a pair of scissors.  But the fact that it can be cut with scissors might give you a clue as to the constitution of the rubber rope.  Also, the plastic jug is fairly durable, but in her frustration to get at the kibble inside, Roxy has done a little damage to the plastic, making it hard to screw the lid back on straight.  So the good news is, great concept for a little dog (it's a small toy, don't give it to a lab, that's not what it was meant for), but maybe not as indestructable as they might think.  I'll buy another one, mainly because Roxy went into hysterics when I tried to hide it from her for a few days.  Clearly her favorite of all toys!  Doesn't want to eat out of her dish anymore!",

    "review_text": "I have a German Shepard Dog, who is trained as a service dog.  While out in public, he receives lots of stimulation, and if I'm asked first, he receives a lot of attention too.<br /><br />As a service dog, he's with me 24 seven.  Everywhere, everyday, all the time. He's a high energy dog, loves playing fetch with balls, but doesn't much like my tv, computer, or napping time. I love him dearly but everyone needs a little away time.<br /><br />I've purchased a number of Busy Buddy toys for him.  The number of Squirrels at two different sizes, and cut the bottom fingers different lengths so some drop out treats easier, some harder.  He enjoys them, they bounce funny, but he can empty them pretty quickly.  Which leads to them being dropped on my lap repeatedly, and not always in the best place.<br /><br />I found the tug a Jug which I didn't expect to last a long time because of the hard plastic jug. I also figured he'd pull the rubber tug out by now time.  Much to my surprise, he's been playing with it for almost a year with none of the problems I'd expected, other than having it dropped on my foot or lap.<br /><br />I've been able to use his normal brand of Kirkland Chicken & Rice kibbles dog food, mixed in with some Beniful for a change of pace. By using his normal kibble, it keeps the cost down, and allows me to adjust his meal portion size accordingly.<br /><br />It's also about the only toy he doesn't bring out to the back yard to hide and then can't find it again.  Which sends me a clear message he is very focused on this toy.<br /><br />Even though he's a large size dog, I didn't buy him the large size, in part because I prefer the rubber tug, in part it keeps the amount of treats down.<br /><br />I highly recommend this toy (and toy line) for their design and not making it impossible to use normal kibble instead of expense treat products designed only for their toys.<br /><br />I'd have given this 5 stars if they'd made the outside of the bottle with a rubber coating, or rubber bumpers so it isn't so noisy on non carpeted flooring.",

    "review_text": "We bought this for our dog as a way to feed him his kibble and entertain him for about 20 minutes a day at the same time. Out of the box, it took him about 10 minutes to figure it out and empty it of the 1 1/2 cups of small kibble. If we fed larger kibble, it might take longer. But because I had read other reviews, I knew this to be the case and followed the advice of others on here. I added some <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CSAJ96\">small tennis balls</a> to the jug and then threw the kibble in on top of it. That helped in 2 ways. First, the kibble didn't spill out of the neck while I was filling it from the bottom. Second, it slowed down the amount of time it took our dog to empty it (about half an hour).<br /><br />Just a word of warning: you will have kibble all over your floor until the dog goes back to eat it up. Ours is pretty good about going back to clean up after himself but you have to have patience that he will do that.",

I have been looking for toys that would hold his interest longer than the 5 minutes it takes him to rip them to pieces, and saw this at my local pet store, but in the small size.  I was thrilled to see the larger size on Amazon, and ordered it.  This is a toy for smart dogs, and, of course, I like to think my dog is smart.  However, he may be too smart.  Gave it to my dog tonight.  It was interesting to watch him try to figure out how to get the treats out, and he seemed occupied.  I walked away to leave him to his work.  10 minutes later, he had chewed through the rope coming out of the top of the bottle.  He cheated.  This had potential to be an awesome, time-consuming toy to same some of my sanity.  Unfortunately, if you have a strong chewer, or a dog who can figure out the short cuts, save your money.",

My 2 boxers love to bat things with their hands, and this thing takes quite some time for them to empty of kibble. The down side is this is my second one, I had the smaller version before and they managed to crack the bottom so that the toy was useless. The last one didn't last long, but I let them use it on concrete so I know that was a big factor. I think this new one will last quite a while as long as I allow them to play only on carpet. My boys use their hands exclusively to play with this thing; if your dogs tend to use their mouths and throw things up into the air I doubt this toy will last.<br /><br />I would love to see a version of this made out of aluminum. The dogs smell the treats, so it's not really necessary for the toy to be transparent. I would gladly pay the extra cost to have one of these made of aluminum, or carbon fiber, or something that I know they could use for a while and not worry about breaking.",

It seems a little harder to get out treats with the regular rope because of the size of it.  It really makes your dogs work for the treats and keeps them occupied for a long time.  You can even take the rope out and put in a golf ball but the treats do come out easier with this method.  My dogs have slammed these things around and there has been no breakage of the product.

First off there are two types of rope that this product can come with - we've seen a cotton rope or a rubber one.  Ours came with the rubber one (as shown in the x-small and small size on amazon).<br />First, my dog took to chewing the jug.  She saw the treats and would hit at the jug.  She also chewed on the grip and bone.  In addition to being loud as others complain, she just kept tripping over it.  She's a clumsy dog, but every couple of minutes it would roll behind her and as the jug is really bulky, kind of knock into her.  Also, the rubber rope didn't stand up to her chewing AT ALL.  In addition, we couldn't find treats that really...came out of it easily at all.  She got it out every now and then, which was good, but she didn't ever figure out how to go about doing so and just tore at the bottom of the judge.<br />For reference, we had the medium/large for about a 40-45 pound 1 year old beagle/basset mix.",

Prior to her getting the rope out of it, she would swing it around like a mace or weapon and bang people on the knees if they weren't paying attention.  Now that the rope has been shredded, I strategically put a larger treat in to prevent the kibble from just falling out.  Good idea, but the design could be modified for safer play.",

    "review_title": "Dog ate the rope, but this thing has endless possibilities!",
    "review_text": "This toy is great! It keeps my Aussie Cattle Dog engaged and working for her food at every meal, and makes her think and strategize at every angle. She is not known for her patience when it comes to getting food out of toys, and she'll easily shred or rip apart whatever she has to get to the food in the most efficient way possible. Less than 24hours after teaching her how this thing works, she figured out that the rope was keeping the food inside, so she promptly took it to her bed and ate the rope. We were initially disappointed - it was a sturdy cotton rope! Watching her just inhale the food out of it (literally, she would tip it neck-down into her mouth and just pour the food out of it with no rope to stop the food), we decided to put some objects inside the bottle to make it more challenging, since the rope idea seemed to be a little too easy for her. We started with two golf balls, then moved up to two racquette balls, then a tennis ball. The tennis ball is almost impossible for her to get the food because it's so large the food won't move around it, so we went back to the racquette balls. So far, so good. She beats the thing against the floor, throws it into walls, and gnaws on it like it's covered in frozen peanut butter, and it holds up like a dream. She's gone from inhaling her food in under 30 seconds to taking almost 2 full minutes to eat a meal.<br /><br />Other reviews have mentioned flimsy plastic, but we've found our's is great and made of sturdy, thick plastic. So far she's only scratched it a little on the outside. Others have complained of the same rope issues we had - the dog unravels or chews it off. Adding objects inside the toy that help block the food is a very simple, extremely cost-effective way of altering the toy to make it easier or more difficult. We change it up sometimes from the racquette balls to small wood blocks, a variety of smaller objects (plastic Gatorade caps, golf balls, etc) - anything that is too big to come out the neck but large enough to block the food without being impossible. We've started putting it in places she has to work to get to before she can eat from it - on a chair, in an open box, hidden under a pillow on the floor, etc. Not a whole lot of effort on our part, but it pays off in spades when she's mentally tired for an hour or so after dinner!",

I love finding toys that challenge her and keeps her busy for a while without my arm having the toss something every 30 seconds.  At first she didn't know what to think of it and got a little frustrated that she couldn't get to her treats, but after a few times with patience and encouragement from mommy, she turned to a pro!  She plays with it so much and understands to stop tipping it over when all the treats are eaten.  She got a little too good and now I have to dilute her treats with dry dog food.  Best treats for this toy: Zukes Mini Naturals Dog Treats.  Pitfall: I hate the screw-on bottom; I can never seem to get it on right so I put all the treats in through the top.  No a big deal for me, but might matter to some.  Bottom line, I'm happy if there is a toy that keeps my crazy puppy entertained.",

I would recomend this to keep your canine pal entertained.<br />My furbaby loves to have kibble or multi-grain cherios plus some biscuits in his!****<br /><br />*****5 months later and I had to write an update. Gizmo is still in love with this toy. He loves to pull it around and scratch on the bottle to see if he can get at the rope, lol. Does he play with it every day...no. But, he doesn't play with any of his toys everyday. I'm so glad that I bought this for him, it has been a great purchase. He still loves it and loves to play with it regardless of treats being in there or not. If your dog is active, smart, loves to pounce and dig this is a great toy option. Is every dog going to love it....no but you can't get a promise of that with any toy! I highly suggest you give this toy a try.",

    "review_text": "I usually am not one to submit reviews but after having used this product for two years I feel that it is definately worth a review.  I love Busy Buddy toys in generalfor my Cairn Terrier and this Tug-A-Jug tops them all.  The bottles that I have always had are in the size small and have an actual rope in the bottle, not the rubber rope as shown.  The actual rope lasts longer as a dog can't as easily chew through it.  A rubber rope of the same size I feel that my dog could have broke into two pieces almost instantly.  I have found that if the rope is broken eventually it can be removed and the toy is not broken!  I add a few ping pong balls inside the bottle and the toy works just as well, if not better.  My dog has enjoyed this toy from day one.  He is very good at figuring out treat dispensing toys and getting bored with them quickly.  The Tug-A-Jug has not bored him yet and it has been 2 years!<br /><br />Besides reviewing the toy itself, I would like to state that I have purchased this both at well known pet stores and here at Amazon.  In the future, I will only buy this from amazon.  It is the exact same thing for almost half the price!  Way to go Amazon, this is great.<br /><br />I highly recommend this Busy Buddy Tug-A-Jug to anyone who has a very smart dog that is food motivated.  5 stars.",

He is a generally smart dog so I was a little disappointed when for the first several days all he would do was lick where the rope went into the toy in hopes of getting the food out. Now, a week or so later he is knocking it all around and seems to have really gotten a hang of it. All of his food fits into the toy, (about a cup) and I am sure more would fit for a larger dog. I think now that he has figured it out I may start putting his meals into it so he doesn't eat too much.<br /><br />This is one of the original reasons why I bought this toy, because he bolts down his food and bloat was a concern. Plus it will give him something to do when I am away at work. On the quality of the material, I would say the plastic bottle is very  hard and seems tough enough to handle being  whacked around against the floor and walls. I cannot give an accurate account, however, because my dog has not shown any interest in chewing this toy. The ball at the end of the neck is a softer plastic, and I think that if he wanted to he could chew it up, but again he is mainly focused on the food aspect, not necessarily chewing up the toy itself.<br /><br /> I would say give your dog some time to figure out the toy and don't be surprised if it takes a week or so to figure out, because now that he has he is always pushing it around the floor.",

Although it intimidated her as a puppy, she has since come to love this toy and begs to be able to play with it. (I wouldn't suggest small dog owners getting the large toy for their small dogs though. It works for Izzy, but my parents toy poodle won't do much more than sniff at it.)<br /><br />DURABILITY: My main concern with buying toys for Izzy is she can destroy most things in a short amount of time. Toys for \"aggressive chewers\" last a couple hours tops, and the only way I get stuffed squeaker toys is purely for her occasional entertainment. The Tug-a-Jug, however, has not been a problem whatsoever; it's still in great condition, and she's been playing with it for a year.<br /><br />TREATS: I would suggest when they're learning how it works, to fill it with treats like Premier Buddy Berries Dog Treats. They're a training treat and very small. Once your dog figures out how to work the treats out, fill it with something like Zuke's 16-Ounce Mini Bakes Dog Treats. These are larger and create a bigger challenge. Also, of course, dog food works great too.<br /><br />This is a great toy and option for dogs that have energy and enjoy a challenge. It's also entertaining to watch them try to get the treats out :)",

I thought maybe he could still use it but that the treat would come out easier, this was not a good idea.

He's a full blown case of a four legged kid who has a terminal case of the \"terrible twos\".<br /><br />Daughter said  it didn't take him long to figure out how to make the treats spill out. She loads it with dehydrated banana and papaya chips and it keeps him occupied for a good 45 minutes with each fill.<br /><br />He's figured out the bottom comes off and tries to find ways to take the bottom off, hasn't managed to do so .....uuummm.......yet ;).<br /><br />She also has five cats who are fascinated by the toy and when the Dobe let's them near it they bat it around and pounce on the rope. She's put some dry kitty food in it a couple times and the cats \"team work\" to get the food to spill out.<br />Dober-baby is only allowed to us the toy on carpeted floors because he tends to swing and bang it on the floor, the cats are put in a room with tile and they shuttle it around until it is empty.<br /><br />I would purchase again and expect I may have to...and soon...... if they cats decide the dog doesn't share fair.",

She kept rolling it down the stairs, off a ledge, and knocking things over when it rolled behind them. But she was thoroughly entertained, so I let it be. The third time she played with it while I was cooking. A few minutes later, I looked down to see she had unscrewed it again, and was chewing on the various pieces happily. I didn't stop her since the brochure said it was virtually indestructible material.

    "review_text": "This Tug-a-Jug turned out to be the perfect thing for our black lab puppy. We put his evening kibble inside and let him roll it around to get his dinner. The jug keeps him occupied for anywhere between 25 minutes to an hour.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Good mental stimulation. Dinner isn't just available to wolf down. It requires some work and is totally worth the reward!<br />2. Sturdy construction. It's held up against the chewy habit of the pup. I do not let him chew on it outside of meal times in order to keep his focus mainly on the food and not the jug.<br />3. The rope seems to be very enjoyable to our pup. He likes to stop and chew on it for a minute before starting to roll and spin the jug again. I'm guessing that has something to do with teething. It's also replaceable (if you can find replacement rope).<br />4. Easy to clean. The bottom screws on/off and the inside can be wiped down.<br />5. Mouth of the jug has a nice texture which helps our pup hold on with his paws. His spin and push control (with his paws) has increased drastically since we started feeding him one meal a day from it!<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Sturdy construction also means it breaks anything fragile in its path. The rope makes it easy to swing around. I would keep the dog and jug away from small pets and children.<br />2. Can't use it with raw food unless you want to make a horrible mess all over the place.<br />3. Loud if you keep it on a linoleum floor like we do. Our pup loves to bang the jug around, spin it with his paws and push it with his nose. It makes quite a racket. It's fairly quiet on the carpet.<br />4. If your dog is really smart, he might figure this one out quickly. I'd recommend pairing this with one of the other Busy Buddy feeding products and switching between them often to keep your dog on his toes.",

As others have said in the reviews, she couldn't get the treats out...she knew they were in there, but they don't come out easily and I put in her smallest doggie food.  Heck, I couldn't even get them out unless I pulled VERY hard on the rope.  She likes the rope, but not for long...she'd like it better by itself.  I got the smallest one and she's a very smart dog, but it's just not for her.  Don't know what I'm going to do with this thing...just put it in her toy box I guess and hope she latches onto it once in a while.  It's a total waste of money in my opinion.  She likes the roller treat dispensers...I even made one myself with an empty plastic peanut jar, used an exacto knife to cut holes on two sides, and she can roll it around and get excited about her treats rolling out...even an empty butter tub can be used.  Save you money on this one.  Just MHO.<br />Update:  My puppy is now 11 pounds, full grown and will be 1 year soon and STILL cannot get the treats out of this thing.  I even have a hard time getting them out....I have to pull the rope HARD to get anything out.

She GOT the treats, but I threw the thing away....total waste of money I think.  Not MHO this time....experience!!",

After filling it with some of his favorite treats (cheerios), i put it on the ground and awaited his reaction.  He was a bit confused at first, but after pushing it and dragging it I think he finally realized how the toy will reward him with play.  Took him a solid hour to go through a handful of treats, and he seemed VERY engaged.  Didn't even notice me cooking in the kitchen (he usually follows and stares and waits for food to fall).",

Too bad they don't make this same toy with a rubber coating.",

    "review_text": "My dog Cooper enjoys this toy as much as he loves his Kong toys.  He still hasn't figured out how to get the food out, but it keeps him occupied for a couple of hours as he tries to figure out how to get it.  Most of the time he chews on the rope.  He has a strong bite and so far the rope is still holding on strong -- this is also why I bought him the medium/large. I felt that if I got him a small he'd chew the rope right off.<br /><br />The only con is that the toy is a little big for him to carry sometimes, and I didn't realize that the plastic bottle was going to be as hard as it is so it makes loud annoying sounds when it drops on the tile and hard wood when he tries to carry it on top of the sofa or bed. So other than the loud banging noises, I'd say this is a good toy. Highly recommend if you have carpet.",

My dog, after just 2 days with it, has already figured out how to get the food out as quickly as possible - by grabbing the bottom of the bottom with his mouth and lifting it upside down. Putting large treats or pingpong balls inside will help make it more challenging.",

    "review_text": "My dog loves tug-a-war with ropes and etc so I thought this would be a great toy for her, since she is left alone during the day while I'm at work.  The problem is that she tugs on the rope, then smells the treats inside, then won't mess with the rope at all and instead spends her time sniffing at the \"scent holes\" and from the neck of the bottle.  She will try to stick her tongue into the neck of the bottle.  I've demonstrated to her over and over that pulling on the rope dispenses a treat, but she just refuses to pull on the rope, even when I hold onto the bottle end and try to get her to play tug-a-war.  She smells the treat and doesn't want to play, she wants the treat, and she doesn't understand it.  I even took AKC liver treats and cut them into 1/4 and liberally filled the bottom of the jar with them, so that even a mild tug on the rope would result in a piece of treat being released.  She just has no interest in pulling on the rope at all.  She will mess with it for a few minutes and when she can't get the treats out, she leaves it alone.  I was pretty disappointed with it.  I think it would help if they made the outside knot smaller so you could pass the rope through the back of the bottle.  That way you I could get my dog to just play with the rope without worrying about the treats and try putting it back in the bottle once she got used to it.  As is, I've had it a month and she doesn't get, so I'm considering cutting the knot off the end so she can at least play with the bottle and dump the treats out, and play with whats left of the rope seperately.",

I break up his hard biscuits and feed them through the top (the bottom screws off but if you put them through the top, you know they can fall out during play) and Walter flings it to the ground and rolls it around the get the treats to fall out. He loves it and it's almost always in his mouth. This is, hands down, his favorite toy.

When my it went to a new home with a foster dog, still in great shape, I knew I needed to purchase another for my Service Dog Toby, as he loves it too. This Tug-a-jug is larger than our last; it is the Medium/Large size. Toby enjoys trying to get whatever I put into it and puts a lot of thought into it. He even prefers having his regular food out of it, even though he could simply go to his bowl to eat. The bottom easily screws off, I fill it with his food, a few treats of varying value and one extremely high value treat (EHVT) that really doesn't come out, but he has hope that some day it will. When I wash it, he gets the contents and thus the EHVT. He knows that I unscrew the bottom, but of course without opposable thumbs, alas he can not. Even so, he tries to figure out how to do that. Dogs can use a lot of energy thinking, chewing and exercising, so I like to give him a variety of each to keep him content. Our last Tug-a-jug being smaller, he would pick it up from the bottom to try to get the food out, this one being bigger, he can no longer do that, so he's had to change his tactics and I've enjoyed watching how his mind works.",

I keep a good eye on it and when it looks like she's about to get another piece off, I just cut that little bit off with a pair of scissors.  But the fact that it can be cut with scissors might give you a clue as to the constitution of the rubber rope.  Also, the plastic jug is fairly durable, but in her frustration to get at the kibble inside, Roxy has done a little damage to the plastic, making it hard to screw the lid back on straight.  So the good news is, great concept for a little dog (it's a small toy, don't give it to a lab, that's not what it was meant for), but maybe not as indestructable as they might think.  I'll buy another one, mainly because Roxy went into hysterics when I tried to hide it from her for a few days.  Clearly her favorite of all toys!  Doesn't want to eat out of her dish anymore!",

While out in public, he receives lots of stimulation, and if I'm asked first, he receives a lot of attention too.<br /><br />As a service dog, he's with me 24 seven.  Everywhere, everyday, all the time. He's a high energy dog, loves playing fetch with balls, but doesn't much like my tv, computer, or napping time. I love him dearly but everyone needs a little away time.<br /><br />I've purchased a number of Busy Buddy toys for him.  The number of Squirrels at two different sizes, and cut the bottom fingers different lengths so some drop out treats easier, some harder.  He enjoys them, they bounce funny, but he can empty them pretty quickly.  Which leads to them being dropped on my lap repeatedly, and not always in the best place.<br /><br />I found the tug a Jug which I didn't expect to last a long time because of the hard plastic jug. I also figured he'd pull the rubber tug out by now time.  Much to my surprise, he's been playing with it for almost a year with none of the problems I'd expected, other than having it dropped on my foot or lap.<br /><br />I've been able to use his normal brand of Kirkland Chicken & Rice kibbles dog food, mixed in with some Beniful for a change of pace. By using his normal kibble, it keeps the cost down, and allows me to adjust his meal portion size accordingly.<br /><br />It's also about the only toy he doesn't bring out to the back yard to hide and then can't find it again.  Which sends me a clear message he is very focused on this toy.<br /><br />Even though he's a large size dog, I didn't buy him the large size, in part because I prefer the rubber tug, in part it keeps the amount of treats down.<br /><br />I highly recommend this toy (and toy line) for their design and not making it impossible to use normal kibble instead of expense treat products designed only for their toys.<br /><br />I'd have given this 5 stars if they'd made the outside of the bottle with a rubber coating, or rubber bumpers so it isn't so noisy on non carpeted flooring.",

    "review_text": "So I am the proud owner of an almost 80-lb. 1-year-old lab mix whose sole mission in life is to seek and destroy.  I have been looking for toys that would hold his interest longer than the 5 minutes it takes him to rip them to pieces, and saw this at my local pet store, but in the small size.  I was thrilled to see the larger size on Amazon, and ordered it.  This is a toy for smart dogs, and, of course, I like to think my dog is smart.  However, he may be too smart.  Gave it to my dog tonight.  It was interesting to watch him try to figure out how to get the treats out, and he seemed occupied.  I walked away to leave him to his work.  10 minutes later, he had chewed through the rope coming out of the top of the bottle.  He cheated.  This had potential to be an awesome, time-consuming toy to same some of my sanity.  Unfortunately, if you have a strong chewer, or a dog who can figure out the short cuts, save your money.",

The rubber on it can be chewed off (so supervision is required), but even with chunks of it gone, it still works great and keeps them busy. Besides the rubber being no challenge to chew through (especially the cord), the biggest down sides are that the plastic is so hard that it could damage some furniture (and feet) and it is loud when they throw it around",

My 2 boxers love to bat things with their hands, and this thing takes quite some time for them to empty of kibble. The down side is this is my second one, I had the smaller version before and they managed to crack the bottom so that the toy was useless. The last one didn't last long, but I let them use it on concrete so I know that was a big factor. I think this new one will last quite a while as long as I allow them to play only on carpet. My boys use their hands exclusively to play with this thing; if your dogs tend to use their mouths and throw things up into the air I doubt this toy will last.<br /><br />I would love to see a version of this made out of aluminum. The dogs smell the treats, so it's not really necessary for the toy to be transparent. I would gladly pay the extra cost to have one of these made of aluminum, or carbon fiber, or something that I know they could use for a while and not worry about breaking.",

I have 2 of the x-small and 1 of the med/large which is really big.  Some of them have a rope and some have a rubber rope.  It seems a little harder to get out treats with the regular rope because of the size of it.  It really makes your dogs work for the treats and keeps them occupied for a long time.  You can even take the rope out and put in a golf ball but the treats do come out easier with this method.  My dogs have slammed these things around and there has been no breakage of the product.  I have 2 German Shepherds so they are pretty tough on toys.  I also like the fact that you can fill these up ahead of time and then give to dogs later when you are leaving.",

First off there are two types of rope that this product can come with - we've seen a cotton rope or a rubber one.  Ours came with the rubber one (as shown in the x-small and small size on amazon).<br />First, my dog took to chewing the jug.  She saw the treats and would hit at the jug.  She also chewed on the grip and bone.  In addition to being loud as others complain, she just kept tripping over it.  She's a clumsy dog, but every couple of minutes it would roll behind her and as the jug is really bulky, kind of knock into her.  Also, the rubber rope didn't stand up to her chewing AT ALL.  In addition, we couldn't find treats that really...came out of it easily at all.  She got it out every now and then, which was good, but she didn't ever figure out how to go about doing so and just tore at the bottom of the judge.<br />For reference, we had the medium/large for about a 40-45 pound 1 year old beagle/basset mix.",

The Pit Bull holds her paws around the rubber ring and turns it over to pour some out.

They are tied for time to get all the treats out!<br /><br />This cannot be played with on tile or wood floors - too noisy for people and jug slides too much for dogs. It would work in a crate, but I won't leave my dogs alone with ANY toy of this sort.<br /><br />It is hard to find dog goodies that will come out most are too thick to pass through. Charlee Bear Treats(any flavor) <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002QX3Q0\">Charlee Bear Dog Treats 16Oz Zip Pack Cheese/Egg</a> work perfectly as do larger sized cat treats. I love watching the dogs as they figure out a new way to make it work. No one has eaten off the rubber ring (the toy would still work if they did) and no one has chewed off the rope.

    "review_text": "This toy is great! It keeps my Aussie Cattle Dog engaged and working for her food at every meal, and makes her think and strategize at every angle. She is not known for her patience when it comes to getting food out of toys, and she'll easily shred or rip apart whatever she has to get to the food in the most efficient way possible. Less than 24hours after teaching her how this thing works, she figured out that the rope was keeping the food inside, so she promptly took it to her bed and ate the rope. We were initially disappointed - it was a sturdy cotton rope! Watching her just inhale the food out of it (literally, she would tip it neck-down into her mouth and just pour the food out of it with no rope to stop the food), we decided to put some objects inside the bottle to make it more challenging, since the rope idea seemed to be a little too easy for her. We started with two golf balls, then moved up to two racquette balls, then a tennis ball. The tennis ball is almost impossible for her to get the food because it's so large the food won't move around it, so we went back to the racquette balls. So far, so good. She beats the thing against the floor, throws it into walls, and gnaws on it like it's covered in frozen peanut butter, and it holds up like a dream. She's gone from inhaling her food in under 30 seconds to taking almost 2 full minutes to eat a meal.<br /><br />Other reviews have mentioned flimsy plastic, but we've found our's is great and made of sturdy, thick plastic. So far she's only scratched it a little on the outside. Others have complained of the same rope issues we had - the dog unravels or chews it off. Adding objects inside the toy that help block the food is a very simple, extremely cost-effective way of altering the toy to make it easier or more difficult. We change it up sometimes from the racquette balls to small wood blocks, a variety of smaller objects (plastic Gatorade caps, golf balls, etc) - anything that is too big to come out the neck but large enough to block the food without being impossible. We've started putting it in places she has to work to get to before she can eat from it - on a chair, in an open box, hidden under a pillow on the floor, etc. Not a whole lot of effort on our part, but it pays off in spades when she's mentally tired for an hour or so after dinner!",

I feed him his meals between various puzzle toys and it does wonders for his destructive tendencies.  I was upset when it broke after only one week.  I have mostly carpet with minimal tile floor, so not sure if he got rough with it on the hard surfaces.  I tried taping the bottom shut after I fill it with food, but eventually the screw part totally fell apart and I had to throw it away.  Not sure I will buy another one at this price.  :(",

    "review_text": "I have a 7lb Maltese boy who loves this toy! I was a little hesitant when I first received it because it is about half as big as he is. It took him a little while to figure out how to get the treats out but he definitely has his methods now. From dragging it around the living room to standing it up by the couch and knocking it back over. Also keeps his interest for a very long time whether it has treats in it or not!!!! I would recomend this to keep your canine pal entertained.<br />My furbaby loves to have kibble or multi-grain cherios plus some biscuits in his!****<br /><br />*****5 months later and I had to write an update. Gizmo is still in love with this toy. He loves to pull it around and scratch on the bottle to see if he can get at the rope, lol. Does he play with it every day...no. But, he doesn't play with any of his toys everyday. I'm so glad that I bought this for him, it has been a great purchase. He still loves it and loves to play with it regardless of treats being in there or not. If your dog is active, smart, loves to pounce and dig this is a great toy option. Is every dog going to love it....no but you can't get a promise of that with any toy! I highly suggest you give this toy a try.",

    "review_text": "I usually am not one to submit reviews but after having used this product for two years I feel that it is definately worth a review.  I love Busy Buddy toys in generalfor my Cairn Terrier and this Tug-A-Jug tops them all.  The bottles that I have always had are in the size small and have an actual rope in the bottle, not the rubber rope as shown.  The actual rope lasts longer as a dog can't as easily chew through it.  A rubber rope of the same size I feel that my dog could have broke into two pieces almost instantly.  I have found that if the rope is broken eventually it can be removed and the toy is not broken!  I add a few ping pong balls inside the bottle and the toy works just as well, if not better.  My dog has enjoyed this toy from day one.  He is very good at figuring out treat dispensing toys and getting bored with them quickly.  The Tug-A-Jug has not bored him yet and it has been 2 years!<br /><br />Besides reviewing the toy itself, I would like to state that I have purchased this both at well known pet stores and here at Amazon.  In the future, I will only buy this from amazon.  It is the exact same thing for almost half the price!  Way to go Amazon, this is great.<br /><br />I highly recommend this Busy Buddy Tug-A-Jug to anyone who has a very smart dog that is food motivated.  5 stars.",

I have gone through A LOT of flours, mixes, recipes and baking disasters.  My daughter also has a sensitivity to corn - there aren't many mixes or products that are free of corn (cornstarch, corn flour, traditionally-made baking powder, etc.) and this one is essentially (if not totally) free of corn.  It also produces awesome pancakes, an easy coating for chicken nuggets, a thickener in place of wheat flour for stew broth, and it totally flies under the radar of the rest of the family as being a GF mix. I stock up on the 3-pack of the 4 lb. bags now because I use it almost every day.  I've never reviewed anything before, but thought that this might actually help someone struggling with how to feed a GF child.",

I freeze my muffins within a day because they get stale easily, but the bread seems to be ok left out or in the fridge.

Also, I just followed the recipe on the bag for zucchini muffins and I can't believe how good they are.  It's the first truly delicious baked good I've had since going gluten free.  Even my non-celiac boyfriend loves them.  The chocolate chip cookies made from this flour aren't quite as good as the real thing, but way better than anything else I've tried yet.  Thank goodness for Pamela's!",

The pancakes are outstanding and easy, but I also use the scones and mix Pamela's with my homemade mixes for muffins, breads, cookies, cobbler, etc.  Amazon's price was $5 cheaper a bag than what I pay at the store (even after shipping) so that helps with the budget.

I've never tried anything gluten free, but used to have to buy \"lactose free\" stuff and I remembered the lousy taste of those things. I was sure that I was about to enter into a Life Devoid of Glutenous Joy.<br /><br />I tentatively made some pumpkin bread using the recipe on the back of the bag. I put it into the oven, fearing that I had just wasted half a can of pumpkin on something that would taste like old socks. Since the recipe used spices and sugar, it might be improved to taste like pumpkin spiced socks. The bread was done and I let it cool. Being impatient, cooling was a 10-15 minute period. Risking second degree burns, I sliced some off and was blown away. It was the best pumpkin bread I have ever tasted! There was no \"something important is missing\" flavor at all.<br /><br />I did alter the recipe a bit:<br /><br />3+ teaspoons of cinnamon<br />1/2 tsp allspice<br />1/2 tsp cloves<br />A slosh or two of vanilla extract (a \"slosh\" is roughly a teaspoon or so)<br />1/2 tsp nutmeg<br />4 TBSP butter flavored Crisco instead of butter/margarine<br />***No salt***<br /><br />The rest of the recipe and procedure was the same. It came out quite well according to the rest of the family, as well. I did not make the suggested topping, either.<br /><br />I don't know how long the bread will last. I put it in a heavy crystal covered cake thingy and it was gone in about three days. It didn't spoil, it was eaten.",

Who could ask for more than that? It doesn't have any bean flour in it so it doesn't have that aftertaste that is common in other mixes. There are some great recipes on Pamela's Website as well, especially the one for Cornbread. It really taste good to mix butter(or margarine) with some roasted pecans and a little honey as a topping for it. It makes really good pancakes too. The bread recipe makes a nice loaf, but I would consider it a desert bread, so although it does ok even if it isn't toasted, it's not really good for sandwiches, but it does work very well when you spread jelly or a chocolate/hazelnut spread on it. I buy this from amazon, it's a great price esp compared to the local health food store.",

    "review_text": "This baking mix is amazing.  I have used it for all of the suggested basics (waffles, pancakes, muffins, biscuits, etc.), but I have also substituted it for flour in nearly all of my old baked goods recipes.  Cookies, quick breads, pound cakes, scones - you name it.  It works great!  Pamela's has basically done the heavy lifting for you - they have found a blend of gluten-free flours that create light, delicious baked goods.  No one I have ever served them to has been able to tell the difference.  The only difficulty is that there is leavening and salt already in the mix, so you may need to slightly adjust your old recipes in order to accomodate this, removing (or lessening) baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  But this is an easy adjustment and the results are terrific!  As a side note, I have used and would recommend Pamela's GF bread mix for regular bread and bagels... I have not attempted either with the baking mix, but the bread mix works great.",

I just thought it should be put out there. I would reccommend this mix absolutely and will continue to use it b/c i don't think the amount of dairy in it is high. Love you Pamela!",

I always add just a little bit more water to the batter than the recipe calls for and get the lightest, most even pancakes ever.  My family is gluten-sensitive but I am not.  Since discovering Pamela's I don't care if I ever have a gluten-made pancake again.  These are tremendous.  I've added choco chips, chopped fruit and pureed fruit to the batter and it all works wonderfully.  If you're looking for a delicious gluten-free pancake, this is the mix you want.  I have used it for banana breads and it's OK for that but not great.",

    "review_text": "Dan's Perfect Popcorn<br /><br />Note:  This is a very thorough recipe, but it is very important you follow these steps closely.<br /><br />Heat 2 TBS of vegetable oil in a medium sized pot for 5 minutes on high.<br /><br />Pour in 1/2 cup of popcorn kernels and leave uncovered.  As soon as the first kernel pops, put the lid on crooked to let the steam escape.<br /><br />Note: If your popcorn rises too high and is close to touching the bottom of the lid (use a clear lid) then remove the lid. Do not let the popcorn touch the moisture that accumulates on the bottom of the lid. It will ruin all those pieces.<br /><br />When finished popping (about 1 second in between pops), pour popcorn into a large bowl and place the empty pot back on the burner (now turned off).<br /><br />Add 1 TBS of unsalted butter (cut into small squares) into the pot you just cooked your popcorn in. Hold the pot and angle it so that the butter just stays on one side of the pot. If there are any remaining bits of popcorn in the pot, use your butter knife to knock them down into the melted butter. These are great little nuggets of joy while eating the popcorn!<br /><br />Slowly pour half of the butter over the popcorn in a circular fashion, starting at the center and working your way outward to the edge of the bowl. You want to pour a little more butter around the center and less around the edges, since the center of the bowl is the deepest. Sprinkle salt (1/2 the amount you would use) over the top. Use your butter knife and your opposite hand together to lightly toss the popcorn.<br /><br />Note: It is important to salt your popcorn after you pour the butter and before tossing, because the salt will stick better to the popcorn.<br /><br />Pour the other half of the melted butter over the popcorn. Sprinkle the other half of salt over your popcorn.  Lightly toss again.  Taste it.  Add salt if necessary.  Eat right away.<br /><br />Note: If you like your popcorn more buttery and/or oily, add 1/2 to 1 TBS of each to the recipe.",

When you pour the salt in with the oil and kernels and then pop the corn you can use the whole salt thing and it won't be salty at all.  If you only cook the kernels in the oil without the salt and then sprinkle the salt on to the popped corn last, it will be immensely salty. (I prefer the immensely salty style).  I really like this popcorn, I make it in a whirly-pop.  It always comes out perfect every time.  I like to add even more buttery-oil-goodness after popping (I like Kernel Seasons popcorn oil) to make it just like movie theater style.  This popcorn is a million times better than prepackaged microwave popcorn, the two are not even in the same league.",

I tried others and they just do not compare.  I am not sure if it is the type of oil they use, the type of salt, or the popcorn itself, but this popcorn is second to none.

I follow the instructions precisely and have tried just about everything but haven't cracked the code yet. Those kernels that do pop are tasty, but it seems like I lose 25 to 30 percent of kernels which don't pop.<br /><br />The other thing to notice, the coconut oil sort of congeals at room temperature, so I found it helpful to warm it up so it's nice an runny before putting it in my popper. Usually I just put the packet between my hand and leg for a few minutes to warm it up. Not a major problem, just something to be aware of.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't do the subscription. I think I may try another brand to see if it makes any difference.<br /><br />BTW, one 8 oz package makes enough to fill three of the bags that come with the machine with a little left over.

More of the kernels popped, they were far fluffier, and the popcorn simply tasted better (this is after salting the West Bend with Paragon Butter Flavored Seasoning Salt). The packs make it very simple. Cut the top, dump in the kettle, hit the heater, wait for the sound of the sizzle, and go! My only concern is that you have to take a bit of care not to drop oil all over the place. If you cut the top off, then carefully 'roll' the pack, it makes it much easier to drop it all in, then squeeze the oil out.",

    "review_text": "I used my Stir Crazy popper - almost every kernel popped, but it's quite dry for an oil popped corn. I think there might just be too much corn for the amount of oil. And definitely doesn't have the movie theater taste or texture. Also, if you put all the seasoning salt in with the corn & oil, a lot of it sticks to the machine, so I leave a little to sprinkle on afterwards to help with the flavor. I'm thinking maybe I'll try not using all the corn, next time and see if that is a better corn-to-oil ratio. I might also try just using a big pot too and see if that's any better than the Stir Crazy.<br /><br />** EDIT ** July 2011 ** so, after popping quite a few bags in different ways, I can say now that if you use a regular kettle, with only 1/2 the salt, it tastes great. I think it's because only about 2/3 of it pops - so this allows for more oil/flavor per kernel.",

    "review_text": "I recently bought an 8 ounce home popper and had read favorable reviews about the pre-packaged kernels, coconut oil, and salt packets.  After scouring Amazon and reading the reviews, I finally settled on Great Northern.<br /><br />The packaged shipped immediately within a day of purchase and arrived on schedule.  Be warned that based on the climate in your area, the oil portion in the packets may be solidified or liquid.  Regardless, it melts instantly in a hot kettle if you receive it solid.<br /><br />As for the taste, I was not disappointed one bit.  Some reviews have mentioned that it is too salty, but I found it just right.  I do prefer salty foods, though.  Based on the look of it, I thought it would turn the popcorn a ridiculous yellow hue, but it didn't.  The taste was exactly like you'd get at the theater or ballpark and it was not too greasy.  I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to make theater style popcorn at home.",

After all, I have used packs like this for over 10 years (at a previous employers Ag Equipment business), of which was amazing!  This product is not. On a scale of 1-10, I'd rate it about a 2. It is edible; although extremely salty. Tastes nothing like carnival style popcorn, severely lacking in butter flavor. The only positive aspect of this product is the convenience in the pack itself. So if you're used to buying cheap jiffy-pop, over the stove style popcorn, this would be better. I Would not recommend.",

    "review_text": "We have a Princeton Popper which we bought from this same company, and have owned for close to a year.<br />They are really great people giving excellent customer support, standing behind their products.<br />With that said, this popcorn is really, really great, and you don't have to have a \"popcorn machine\" to use it. You can cook it on the stove in a big tall pot like you would use for sweet corn. My only suggestion is not to put the lid on the pot but to put a mesh splatter screen over it. This will permit the vapor to escape keeping the popcorn light and fluffy and not moist.<br />This popcorn is so good you don't need to add butter either. It's fine just the way it is which is better for our health too. I have two family members that have bought Princeton machines and this popcorn because they liked ours so much, and any time friends come over for a movie or just to visit, they always ask if I would make popcorn.<br />The 8 oz. cases shipped free through Amazon really don't cost any more per oz. than you'd pay for Orville microwave in a grocery store and is hundered fold better. Ever eat left-over microwave popcorn the next day?....Yuk, it's disgusting. And you're not suppose to breath the vapor when you first open the bag fresh out of the microwave, and you want to eat that stuff? Great Northern still tastes fresh and good for days if you bag it up. After your first bag of Great Northern you'll wonder why on Earth you ever keep eating that junk from the grocery store.",

    "review_title": "Saturated Fat Nightmare",
    "review_text": "With all the reviews of this popcorn, I'm surprised not to find any mention of the horrible saturated fat content of this. Anyone with any concern about their cholesterol or saturated fat content really needs to look closely at the nutritional guide. I couldn't find it listed on their website so I asked them to email me a copy. Wow, 40g of saturated fats in one of these packets and they call it 5 servings. Daily limit of saturated fats for a 2,000 calorie/day person is 16. You would have to eat 4 big macs to match the saturated content of this popcorn. The biggest concern I have with this is the company told me it has no plans to even offer a healthful alternative for pre-packaged packets like this. The problem is entirely with the oil they are using. Coconut oil. They list on their packet no cholesterol and no trans fats, but there's conveniently no mention of the overwhelming amount of saturated fats due to the coconut oil. Most movie theaters have finally changed from coconut oil to canola or other good oils to address this major health concern and bad press over the years. I asked Great Northern to please follow suit, not even asking them to replace this oil with the good oils but to just offer an alternative. They refused. It tastes just as good to me at the movie theaters. In some cases the saturated fats have been reduced 15 times with the change from coconut to good oils. I love popcorn. But health is a concern to me. If you are concerned about saturated fats, look at the nutritional guide for these packets.",

I just had a bowl and it was scrum-del-e-icious.  nowhere near as greasy as microwave popcorn, but still just as flavorful.<br /><br />Update 2012<br /><br />The first time I bought this popcorn it was so delicious, but I noticed when I received the 2nd box a few months later it wasn't nearly as good.  the popcorn was a little stale.  I thought it was because I switched to a new popcorn popper and it was over steaming the popcorn.  Now after reading some of the current reviews I am a little scared to buy it again.  That's too bad cause it was once really good. I see the price has gone up a few dollars too.  So now you have to pay more for lower quality.",

In the second pan I used only half the oil that came with it, it popped the same as the first pan and would have tasted good except for the extreme amount of salt.  this popcorn is so salty I couldn't eat it and my husband who is a salt addict even complained about too much salt!  I will add that the butter flavor does not taste like butter and has a very slight chemical aftertaste. I bought a case so we have a great deal to use yet.  in the future I'll try to sift the salt out of the popcorn before adding the kernels to the pan.  there were many old maids and the popped kernels were not as big and fluffy as Redenbacher's.  Also one pack only made about 1/2 pan of popcorn in my whirley-pop popcorn maker which is too bad as i had hoped it would be just the right amount.  I'm very disappointed in the quality of this popcorn.  At the price I expect a so called gourmet popcorn to make a whole pan, taste better and pop fluffier than what I can get from grocery store kernels.",

    "review_text": "I bought this popcorn to use with the Whirley Popper (a highly recommended purchase) I purchased on Amazon.  This popcorn is great-tasting with an ever-so-slight hint of coconut ... yes that is the extra something you taste in movie-theater corn! It's better than the popcorn from Wabash Valley Farms (the brand that comes with the Whirley Popper), in my opinion.  It tastes just like the kind you get at the movie theater or a carnival and the smell is just fantastic.  When using my WhirleyPop I usually only get about 10-12 unpopped kernels.  The more comfortable I get using the popper I'm sure that number will decrease.  The corn pops up nice and crispy without any greasiness (as sometimes movie theater popcorn can be).<br /><br />However, I do think that the popcorn is a bit too salty (thus giving it 4 stars instead of 5) for my family's taste so I use only 1/2 - 3/4 of the seasoning versus using the entire packet.<br /><br />I think I got a great deal being that I recieved the popcorn, oil, and seasoning all for $39.99 and free shipping.  It couldn't be easier because all I do is dump it all in the popper and 'turn the crank!<br /><br />A minor complaint I do have, and I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else, is that a few of the packets do leak a little bit; nothing major but enough to notice.  I will continue to purchase this brand because of the great taste and ease of use!<br /><br />UPDATE***In retrospect $39.99 wasn't that great of a deal being that now, the price has gone down by $10+!  :o)  I have been using my popper with this popcorn for quite some time now and rarely get any more than 5-10 unpopped kernels.  I have tried other brands as well, buying bulk popcorn kernels with Orvil Reddenbocker's popcorn oil and they do not even compare.  I did it to try and save a bit more money and not only did my popcorn not come out to my liking, it was quite a pain measuring the ingredients.  I will be sticking to Great American!",

In our search we came across this popcorn and thought we should give it a try.  We got the same amount of popcorn for half the price, which was huge bonus for us.  Once we received it, we had to try it right away and we were thoroughly impressed with it.  It is even better than the previous brand.  Fabulous product!",

    "review_title": "Dan's Perfect Popcorn",
    "review_text": "Dan's Perfect Popcorn<br /><br />Note:  This is a very thorough recipe, but it is very important you follow these steps closely.<br /><br />Heat 2 TBS of vegetable oil in a medium sized pot for 5 minutes on high.<br /><br />Pour in 1/2 cup of popcorn kernels and leave uncovered.  As soon as the first kernel pops, put the lid on crooked to let the steam escape.<br /><br />Note: If your popcorn rises too high and is close to touching the bottom of the lid (use a clear lid) then remove the lid. Do not let the popcorn touch the moisture that accumulates on the bottom of the lid. It will ruin all those pieces.<br /><br />When finished popping (about 1 second in between pops), pour popcorn into a large bowl and place the empty pot back on the burner (now turned off).<br /><br />Add 1 TBS of unsalted butter (cut into small squares) into the pot you just cooked your popcorn in. Hold the pot and angle it so that the butter just stays on one side of the pot. If there are any remaining bits of popcorn in the pot, use your butter knife to knock them down into the melted butter. These are great little nuggets of joy while eating the popcorn!<br /><br />Slowly pour half of the butter over the popcorn in a circular fashion, starting at the center and working your way outward to the edge of the bowl. You want to pour a little more butter around the center and less around the edges, since the center of the bowl is the deepest. Sprinkle salt (1/2 the amount you would use) over the top. Use your butter knife and your opposite hand together to lightly toss the popcorn.<br /><br />Note: It is important to salt your popcorn after you pour the butter and before tossing, because the salt will stick better to the popcorn.<br /><br />Pour the other half of the melted butter over the popcorn. Sprinkle the other half of salt over your popcorn.  Lightly toss again.  Taste it.  Add salt if necessary.  Eat right away.<br /><br />Note: If you like your popcorn more buttery and/or oily, add 1/2 to 1 TBS of each to the recipe.",

We had many unpopped kernels and the taste was only okay.<br /><br />Then I ordered a case of Great Northern Popcorn 8-Ounce Portion Packs. This popcorn is great! We love the taste even three days after popping on the occasion when it lasts that long. We just followed the instructions on the package and all is well.<br /><br />I was a little concerned when I first noticed the oil was in a soft, but solid state. It melts quickly though. The only complaint I have is that it is a little difficult to pour it all in at once, but this is due to the layout of my popcorn popper.<br /><br />We have had friends over for football parties and they have requested more popcorn.",

    "review_text": "The saltiness depends on how you prepare it.  When you pour the salt in with the oil and kernels and then pop the corn you can use the whole salt thing and it won't be salty at all.  If you only cook the kernels in the oil without the salt and then sprinkle the salt on to the popped corn last, it will be immensely salty. (I prefer the immensely salty style).  I really like this popcorn, I make it in a whirly-pop.  It always comes out perfect every time.  I like to add even more buttery-oil-goodness after popping (I like Kernel Seasons popcorn oil) to make it just like movie theater style.  This popcorn is a million times better than prepackaged microwave popcorn, the two are not even in the same league.",

I tried others and they just do not compare.  I am not sure if it is the type of oil they use, the type of salt, or the popcorn itself, but this popcorn is second to none.  Also, everything is conveniently measured out for you, so this makes the task of making popcorn so much simpler.  If you try it, you may be surprised how much more popcorn you start to eat!",

I follow the instructions precisely and have tried just about everything but haven't cracked the code yet. Those kernels that do pop are tasty, but it seems like I lose 25 to 30 percent of kernels which don't pop.<br /><br />The other thing to notice, the coconut oil sort of congeals at room temperature, so I found it helpful to warm it up so it's nice an runny before putting it in my popper. Usually I just put the packet between my hand and leg for a few minutes to warm it up. Not a major problem, just something to be aware of.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't do the subscription. I think I may try another brand to see if it makes any difference.<br /><br />BTW, one 8 oz package makes enough to fill three of the bags that come with the machine with a little left over.

More of the kernels popped, they were far fluffier, and the popcorn simply tasted better (this is after salting the West Bend with Paragon Butter Flavored Seasoning Salt). The packs make it very simple. Cut the top, dump in the kettle, hit the heater, wait for the sound of the sizzle, and go! My only concern is that you have to take a bit of care not to drop oil all over the place. If you cut the top off, then carefully 'roll' the pack, it makes it much easier to drop it all in, then squeeze the oil out.",

No worries about whether you have too much oil, too little popcorn, etc.  It includes the buttered flavoring in powdered form.  But you can also not use the flavoring if you prefer....and use your own if you want to change it up.  I highly recommend this product and am ready to purchase my next 24 pack!",

    "review_text": "I used my Stir Crazy popper - almost every kernel popped, but it's quite dry for an oil popped corn. I think there might just be too much corn for the amount of oil. And definitely doesn't have the movie theater taste or texture. Also, if you put all the seasoning salt in with the corn & oil, a lot of it sticks to the machine, so I leave a little to sprinkle on afterwards to help with the flavor. I'm thinking maybe I'll try not using all the corn, next time and see if that is a better corn-to-oil ratio. I might also try just using a big pot too and see if that's any better than the Stir Crazy.<br /><br />** EDIT ** July 2011 ** so, after popping quite a few bags in different ways, I can say now that if you use a regular kettle, with only 1/2 the salt, it tastes great. I think it's because only about 2/3 of it pops - so this allows for more oil/flavor per kernel.",

After scouring Amazon and reading the reviews, I finally settled on Great Northern.<br /><br />The packaged shipped immediately within a day of purchase and arrived on schedule.  Be warned that based on the climate in your area, the oil portion in the packets may be solidified or liquid.  Regardless, it melts instantly in a hot kettle if you receive it solid.<br /><br />As for the taste, I was not disappointed one bit.  Some reviews have mentioned that it is too salty, but I found it just right.  I do prefer salty foods, though.  Based on the look of it, I thought it would turn the popcorn a ridiculous yellow hue, but it didn't.  The taste was exactly like you'd get at the theater or ballpark and it was not too greasy.  I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to make theater style popcorn at home.",

After all, I have used packs like this for over 10 years (at a previous employers Ag Equipment business), of which was amazing!  This product is not. On a scale of 1-10, I'd rate it about a 2. It is edible; although extremely salty. Tastes nothing like carnival style popcorn, severely lacking in butter flavor. The only positive aspect of this product is the convenience in the pack itself. So if you're used to buying cheap jiffy-pop, over the stove style popcorn, this would be better. I Would not recommend.",

    "review_text": "We have a Princeton Popper which we bought from this same company, and have owned for close to a year.<br />They are really great people giving excellent customer support, standing behind their products.<br />With that said, this popcorn is really, really great, and you don't have to have a \"popcorn machine\" to use it. You can cook it on the stove in a big tall pot like you would use for sweet corn. My only suggestion is not to put the lid on the pot but to put a mesh splatter screen over it. This will permit the vapor to escape keeping the popcorn light and fluffy and not moist.<br />This popcorn is so good you don't need to add butter either. It's fine just the way it is which is better for our health too. I have two family members that have bought Princeton machines and this popcorn because they liked ours so much, and any time friends come over for a movie or just to visit, they always ask if I would make popcorn.<br />The 8 oz. cases shipped free through Amazon really don't cost any more per oz. than you'd pay for Orville microwave in a grocery store and is hundered fold better. Ever eat left-over microwave popcorn the next day?....Yuk, it's disgusting. And you're not suppose to breath the vapor when you first open the bag fresh out of the microwave, and you want to eat that stuff? Great Northern still tastes fresh and good for days if you bag it up. After your first bag of Great Northern you'll wonder why on Earth you ever keep eating that junk from the grocery store.",

    "review_title": "Saturated Fat Nightmare",
    "review_text": "With all the reviews of this popcorn, I'm surprised not to find any mention of the horrible saturated fat content of this. Anyone with any concern about their cholesterol or saturated fat content really needs to look closely at the nutritional guide. I couldn't find it listed on their website so I asked them to email me a copy. Wow, 40g of saturated fats in one of these packets and they call it 5 servings. Daily limit of saturated fats for a 2,000 calorie/day person is 16. You would have to eat 4 big macs to match the saturated content of this popcorn. The biggest concern I have with this is the company told me it has no plans to even offer a healthful alternative for pre-packaged packets like this. The problem is entirely with the oil they are using. Coconut oil. They list on their packet no cholesterol and no trans fats, but there's conveniently no mention of the overwhelming amount of saturated fats due to the coconut oil. Most movie theaters have finally changed from coconut oil to canola or other good oils to address this major health concern and bad press over the years. I asked Great Northern to please follow suit, not even asking them to replace this oil with the good oils but to just offer an alternative. They refused. It tastes just as good to me at the movie theaters. In some cases the saturated fats have been reduced 15 times with the change from coconut to good oils. I love popcorn. But health is a concern to me. If you are concerned about saturated fats, look at the nutritional guide for these packets.",

Now, the popcorn is just the way I like it and I added just a bit of butter. Try it first and then see if the salt/seasoning is too much for you - it was very easy to remove.

I thought it was because I switched to a new popcorn popper and it was over steaming the popcorn.  Now after reading some of the current reviews I am a little scared to buy it again.  That's too bad cause it was once really good. I see the price has gone up a few dollars too.  So now you have to pay more for lower quality.",

In the second pan I used only half the oil that came with it, it popped the same as the first pan and would have tasted good except for the extreme amount of salt.  this popcorn is so salty I couldn't eat it and my husband who is a salt addict even complained about too much salt!  I will add that the butter flavor does not taste like butter and has a very slight chemical aftertaste. I bought a case so we have a great deal to use yet.  in the future I'll try to sift the salt out of the popcorn before adding the kernels to the pan.  there were many old maids and the popped kernels were not as big and fluffy as Redenbacher's.  Also one pack only made about 1/2 pan of popcorn in my whirley-pop popcorn maker which is too bad as i had hoped it would be just the right amount.  I'm very disappointed in the quality of this popcorn.  At the price I expect a so called gourmet popcorn to make a whole pan, taste better and pop fluffier than what I can get from grocery store kernels.",

    "review_text": "I bought this popcorn to use with the Whirley Popper (a highly recommended purchase) I purchased on Amazon.  This popcorn is great-tasting with an ever-so-slight hint of coconut ... yes that is the extra something you taste in movie-theater corn! It's better than the popcorn from Wabash Valley Farms (the brand that comes with the Whirley Popper), in my opinion.  It tastes just like the kind you get at the movie theater or a carnival and the smell is just fantastic.  When using my WhirleyPop I usually only get about 10-12 unpopped kernels.  The more comfortable I get using the popper I'm sure that number will decrease.  The corn pops up nice and crispy without any greasiness (as sometimes movie theater popcorn can be).<br /><br />However, I do think that the popcorn is a bit too salty (thus giving it 4 stars instead of 5) for my family's taste so I use only 1/2 - 3/4 of the seasoning versus using the entire packet.<br /><br />I think I got a great deal being that I recieved the popcorn, oil, and seasoning all for $39.99 and free shipping.  It couldn't be easier because all I do is dump it all in the popper and 'turn the crank!<br /><br />A minor complaint I do have, and I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else, is that a few of the packets do leak a little bit; nothing major but enough to notice.  I will continue to purchase this brand because of the great taste and ease of use!<br /><br />UPDATE***In retrospect $39.99 wasn't that great of a deal being that now, the price has gone down by $10+!  :o)  I have been using my popper with this popcorn for quite some time now and rarely get any more than 5-10 unpopped kernels.  I have tried other brands as well, buying bulk popcorn kernels with Orvil Reddenbocker's popcorn oil and they do not even compare.  I did it to try and save a bit more money and not only did my popcorn not come out to my liking, it was quite a pain measuring the ingredients.  I will be sticking to Great American!",

Why waste storage space on the coconut oil and popcorn kernels?

Once we received it, we had to try it right away and we were thoroughly impressed with it.  It is even better than the previous brand.  Fabulous product!",

    "review_text": "Dan's Perfect Popcorn<br /><br />Note:  This is a very thorough recipe, but it is very important you follow these steps closely.<br /><br />Heat 2 TBS of vegetable oil in a medium sized pot for 5 minutes on high.<br /><br />Pour in 1/2 cup of popcorn kernels and leave uncovered.  As soon as the first kernel pops, put the lid on crooked to let the steam escape.<br /><br />Note: If your popcorn rises too high and is close to touching the bottom of the lid (use a clear lid) then remove the lid. Do not let the popcorn touch the moisture that accumulates on the bottom of the lid. It will ruin all those pieces.<br /><br />When finished popping (about 1 second in between pops), pour popcorn into a large bowl and place the empty pot back on the burner (now turned off).<br /><br />Add 1 TBS of unsalted butter (cut into small squares) into the pot you just cooked your popcorn in. Hold the pot and angle it so that the butter just stays on one side of the pot. If there are any remaining bits of popcorn in the pot, use your butter knife to knock them down into the melted butter. These are great little nuggets of joy while eating the popcorn!<br /><br />Slowly pour half of the butter over the popcorn in a circular fashion, starting at the center and working your way outward to the edge of the bowl. You want to pour a little more butter around the center and less around the edges, since the center of the bowl is the deepest. Sprinkle salt (1/2 the amount you would use) over the top. Use your butter knife and your opposite hand together to lightly toss the popcorn.<br /><br />Note: It is important to salt your popcorn after you pour the butter and before tossing, because the salt will stick better to the popcorn.<br /><br />Pour the other half of the melted butter over the popcorn. Sprinkle the other half of salt over your popcorn.  Lightly toss again.  Taste it.  Add salt if necessary.  Eat right away.<br /><br />Note: If you like your popcorn more buttery and/or oily, add 1/2 to 1 TBS of each to the recipe.",

When you pour the salt in with the oil and kernels and then pop the corn you can use the whole salt thing and it won't be salty at all.  If you only cook the kernels in the oil without the salt and then sprinkle the salt on to the popped corn last, it will be immensely salty. (I prefer the immensely salty style).  I really like this popcorn, I make it in a whirly-pop.  It always comes out perfect every time.  I like to add even more buttery-oil-goodness after popping (I like Kernel Seasons popcorn oil) to make it just like movie theater style.  This popcorn is a million times better than prepackaged microwave popcorn, the two are not even in the same league.",

I tried others and they just do not compare.  I am not sure if it is the type of oil they use, the type of salt, or the popcorn itself, but this popcorn is second to none.

I follow the instructions precisely and have tried just about everything but haven't cracked the code yet. Those kernels that do pop are tasty, but it seems like I lose 25 to 30 percent of kernels which don't pop.<br /><br />The other thing to notice, the coconut oil sort of congeals at room temperature, so I found it helpful to warm it up so it's nice an runny before putting it in my popper. Usually I just put the packet between my hand and leg for a few minutes to warm it up. Not a major problem, just something to be aware of.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't do the subscription. I think I may try another brand to see if it makes any difference.<br /><br />BTW, one 8 oz package makes enough to fill three of the bags that come with the machine with a little left over.

The packs make it very simple. Cut the top, dump in the kettle, hit the heater, wait for the sound of the sizzle, and go!

No worries about whether you have too much oil, too little popcorn, etc.  It includes the buttered flavoring in powdered form.

    "review_text": "I used my Stir Crazy popper - almost every kernel popped, but it's quite dry for an oil popped corn. I think there might just be too much corn for the amount of oil. And definitely doesn't have the movie theater taste or texture. Also, if you put all the seasoning salt in with the corn & oil, a lot of it sticks to the machine, so I leave a little to sprinkle on afterwards to help with the flavor. I'm thinking maybe I'll try not using all the corn, next time and see if that is a better corn-to-oil ratio. I might also try just using a big pot too and see if that's any better than the Stir Crazy.<br /><br />** EDIT ** July 2011 ** so, after popping quite a few bags in different ways, I can say now that if you use a regular kettle, with only 1/2 the salt, it tastes great. I think it's because only about 2/3 of it pops - so this allows for more oil/flavor per kernel.",

After scouring Amazon and reading the reviews, I finally settled on Great Northern.<br /><br />The packaged shipped immediately within a day of purchase and arrived on schedule.  Be warned that based on the climate in your area, the oil portion in the packets may be solidified or liquid.  Regardless, it melts instantly in a hot kettle if you receive it solid.<br /><br />As for the taste, I was not disappointed one bit.  Some reviews have mentioned that it is too salty, but I found it just right.  I do prefer salty foods, though.  Based on the look of it, I thought it would turn the popcorn a ridiculous yellow hue, but it didn't.  The taste was exactly like you'd get at the theater or ballpark and it was not too greasy.  I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to make theater style popcorn at home.",

    "review_text": "With all the rave reviews, coupled with the fact that these pre-packs include all the right ingredients, I assumed the  result would be at least 75% authentic carnival style popcorn for my popcorn maker. After all, I have used packs like this for over 10 years (at a previous employers Ag Equipment business), of which was amazing!  This product is not. On a scale of 1-10, I'd rate it about a 2. It is edible; although extremely salty. Tastes nothing like carnival style popcorn, severely lacking in butter flavor. The only positive aspect of this product is the convenience in the pack itself. So if you're used to buying cheap jiffy-pop, over the stove style popcorn, this would be better. I Would not recommend.",

    "review_text": "We have a Princeton Popper which we bought from this same company, and have owned for close to a year.<br />They are really great people giving excellent customer support, standing behind their products.<br />With that said, this popcorn is really, really great, and you don't have to have a \"popcorn machine\" to use it. You can cook it on the stove in a big tall pot like you would use for sweet corn. My only suggestion is not to put the lid on the pot but to put a mesh splatter screen over it. This will permit the vapor to escape keeping the popcorn light and fluffy and not moist.<br />This popcorn is so good you don't need to add butter either. It's fine just the way it is which is better for our health too. I have two family members that have bought Princeton machines and this popcorn because they liked ours so much, and any time friends come over for a movie or just to visit, they always ask if I would make popcorn.<br />The 8 oz. cases shipped free through Amazon really don't cost any more per oz. than you'd pay for Orville microwave in a grocery store and is hundered fold better. Ever eat left-over microwave popcorn the next day?....Yuk, it's disgusting. And you're not suppose to breath the vapor when you first open the bag fresh out of the microwave, and you want to eat that stuff? Great Northern still tastes fresh and good for days if you bag it up. After your first bag of Great Northern you'll wonder why on Earth you ever keep eating that junk from the grocery store.",

    "review_title": "Saturated Fat Nightmare",
    "review_text": "With all the reviews of this popcorn, I'm surprised not to find any mention of the horrible saturated fat content of this. Anyone with any concern about their cholesterol or saturated fat content really needs to look closely at the nutritional guide. I couldn't find it listed on their website so I asked them to email me a copy. Wow, 40g of saturated fats in one of these packets and they call it 5 servings. Daily limit of saturated fats for a 2,000 calorie/day person is 16. You would have to eat 4 big macs to match the saturated content of this popcorn. The biggest concern I have with this is the company told me it has no plans to even offer a healthful alternative for pre-packaged packets like this. The problem is entirely with the oil they are using. Coconut oil. They list on their packet no cholesterol and no trans fats, but there's conveniently no mention of the overwhelming amount of saturated fats due to the coconut oil. Most movie theaters have finally changed from coconut oil to canola or other good oils to address this major health concern and bad press over the years. I asked Great Northern to please follow suit, not even asking them to replace this oil with the good oils but to just offer an alternative. They refused. It tastes just as good to me at the movie theaters. In some cases the saturated fats have been reduced 15 times with the change from coconut to good oils. I love popcorn. But health is a concern to me. If you are concerned about saturated fats, look at the nutritional guide for these packets.",

Now, the popcorn is just the way I like it and I added just a bit of butter. Try it first and then see if the salt/seasoning is too much for you - it was very easy to remove.

    "review_text": "I purchased a case of this popcorn for two reasons: the rave reviews of others on Amazon and it was a lower-priced alternative to Wabash Valley Farms Real Theater Popcorn.<br /><br />This is what I found:<br /><br />- In my opinion, Great Northern Popcorn is not as tasty as Real Theater Popcorn.<br />- While Great Northern has a 6-ounce portion compared to Wabash Valley Farms 5.5 ounce portion it exceeded the capacity on both my Whirley Pop and Stir Crazy poppers.  (Literally lifted the top off of my Stir Crazy.)  So more is not necessarily better especially when you have to clean up a mess after every popping.<br />- Quite bit more of the Great Northern Popcorn remained unpopped.<br />- Great Northern Popcorn had a \"chewy\" texture to it.",

I thought it was because I switched to a new popcorn popper and it was over steaming the popcorn.  Now after reading some of the current reviews I am a little scared to buy it again.  That's too bad cause it was once really good. I see the price has gone up a few dollars too.  So now you have to pay more for lower quality.",

In the second pan I used only half the oil that came with it, it popped the same as the first pan and would have tasted good except for the extreme amount of salt.  this popcorn is so salty I couldn't eat it and my husband who is a salt addict even complained about too much salt!  I will add that the butter flavor does not taste like butter and has a very slight chemical aftertaste. I bought a case so we have a great deal to use yet.  in the future I'll try to sift the salt out of the popcorn before adding the kernels to the pan.  there were many old maids and the popped kernels were not as big and fluffy as Redenbacher's.  Also one pack only made about 1/2 pan of popcorn in my whirley-pop popcorn maker which is too bad as i had hoped it would be just the right amount.  I'm very disappointed in the quality of this popcorn.  At the price I expect a so called gourmet popcorn to make a whole pan, taste better and pop fluffier than what I can get from grocery store kernels.",

    "review_title": "Delicious, Quality Popcorn",
    "review_text": "I bought this popcorn to use with the Whirley Popper (a highly recommended purchase) I purchased on Amazon.  This popcorn is great-tasting with an ever-so-slight hint of coconut ... yes that is the extra something you taste in movie-theater corn! It's better than the popcorn from Wabash Valley Farms (the brand that comes with the Whirley Popper), in my opinion.  It tastes just like the kind you get at the movie theater or a carnival and the smell is just fantastic.  When using my WhirleyPop I usually only get about 10-12 unpopped kernels.  The more comfortable I get using the popper I'm sure that number will decrease.  The corn pops up nice and crispy without any greasiness (as sometimes movie theater popcorn can be).<br /><br />However, I do think that the popcorn is a bit too salty (thus giving it 4 stars instead of 5) for my family's taste so I use only 1/2 - 3/4 of the seasoning versus using the entire packet.<br /><br />I think I got a great deal being that I recieved the popcorn, oil, and seasoning all for $39.99 and free shipping.  It couldn't be easier because all I do is dump it all in the popper and 'turn the crank!<br /><br />A minor complaint I do have, and I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else, is that a few of the packets do leak a little bit; nothing major but enough to notice.  I will continue to purchase this brand because of the great taste and ease of use!<br /><br />UPDATE***In retrospect $39.99 wasn't that great of a deal being that now, the price has gone down by $10+!  :o)  I have been using my popper with this popcorn for quite some time now and rarely get any more than 5-10 unpopped kernels.  I have tried other brands as well, buying bulk popcorn kernels with Orvil Reddenbocker's popcorn oil and they do not even compare.  I did it to try and save a bit more money and not only did my popcorn not come out to my liking, it was quite a pain measuring the ingredients.  I will be sticking to Great American!",

However, in the many months of absence of the Senseo pods (did they think I was going to stop drinking coffee and wait?  Lol, NO!), I found another brand that is comparable, just as good, but just about the same price:  Baronet dark roast makes pods that are also excellent coffee.  So if Senseo again stops production, I have another brand to fall back on. Bottom line, Senseo coffee is back, it's still delicious, but I don't trust them to stay in production, so I have Baronet as my back up plan.",

    "review_text": "I actually love both systems but I find the Senseo coffee to be easier on my stomach without a loss of flavor. The Senseo pods are much easier to composite given there is no plastic in the container, just paper. However, the fact that there is somewhat less of a mess with the Keurig pod, consumers are more apt to go with this convenience than with the recycling aspect. Alas, we can not find Senseo in our supermarkets anymore.",

I even used TWO pods for the smaller cup of coffee and it was still way too wimpy for me.  It still had the nice crema layer, it just had no taste.  I realize everyone has different coffee preferences.  But for someone who likes a stronger, more espresso-like coffee, I would tell them to steer clear of this roast.",

The only off putting problem I had was these are really sweet. I don't mean sweet potato sweet, I mean eating a salty sugar cube sweet. I checked and the carb count isn't bad, there are only 2 grams of sugar, but these have a weird sweet taste and a strange after taste.

They have a sort of puffy physical trait and kind of remind me of the Munchos chips I used to eat as a kid.  You still get the crunchy feeling of a chip, but they are just \"different\" than a regular potato chip.<br /><br />As a huge fan of barbecue Popchips, I was very anxious to try the Chili Lime flavor.  After the first few chips I ate, I didn't think there was much kick to it.  However, it seems like the more you eat, the spicier they get.  I didn't neccesarily taste the lime in it.  I would personally prefer a little sweetness to the chili flavor, which it didn't have, so maybe that's where the lime falls in.  Overall, these chips have a lot of flavor and are decently spicy.  They are now my 2nd favorite Popchips flavor behind the barbecue.  So, if you like a little spice in your chips, definitely try the chili lime variety.",

    "review_text": "NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're \"probably\" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a \"tomato\" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like \"Tomato and Basil\" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now.",

My sugar is high but I feel comfortable eating these in moderation since the carbs are lower than chips.<br /><br />  I originally bought the variety pack so I could try them all, and I liked them all although somewhat partial to the Cheddar. It's just a matter of what mood I am in as to which one I'll choose.<br /> Unfortunately they are a bit pricy if you don't get them on sale. I just wish these came in a larger bag as opposed to the individual servings which are always more expensive.<br /><br /> Everyone has a different idea of good, so this is something you are going to have to try for yourself to decide.",

    "review_text": "I absolutely LOVE popchips!  So far, I have tried the plain (really don't like these - no flavor at all), BBQ (very nice, rather sweet - I do like these) and Salt & Pepper (by FAR my favorite).  The Salt & Pepper are VERY peppery.  More Pepper than Salt, but I really enjoy the savory bite these have.  I really enjoy the texture of these as well.  Of course I really enjoy rice cakes as well and these are similar in taste \"weight\" but the texture is more like maybe a thick (yet still light) Munchos, or maybe like a flattened out pork rind.  Like I said however, these are not for everyone.  My husband really doesn't like them much.  So far he only sort-of likes the Salt & Pepper.  I would suggest going on PopChips website and see where they are sold locally, around me they are sold at Target Stores.",

    "review_text": "We got the sweet potato flavor through the Vine program.  I was genuinely surprised by how good these were.  Crunchy but light texture.  Just the right balance of sweet and salty.  Portion controlled bags have only a 100 calories and 95 mg of sodium.  These are definitely a healthier alternative to potato chips.  But don't mistake \"healthier\" for \"healthy.\"  They have almost no nutritional value (1 g protein, 2% iron).  So don't let all the buzzwords on the packaging fool you.  Still, if you are looking for a light snack that won't ruin your diet, this is a good choice.  As an FYI, despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe, sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.  Rice flour is the first ingredient, followed by sweet potato flakes, tapioca starch, a blend of various oils, corn flour, seasonings, etc. Not a huge deal, but its one of those \"truth in advertising\" points that annoys me so I mention it.",

The flavor of the sweet potato is just right, mixed with a bit of saltiness - very tasty!  Just the right amount of light crunch, more like popcorn.<br /><br />At 100 calories per bag, these fit right into my eating plan that allows two 100-150 calorie snacks per day.  That made me extra happy!  There are plenty in the bag, too, unlike the small servings usually found in low-calorie snack packs.<br /><br />I shared these with a friend who came over one afternoon, since she also professed a love of sweet potatoes.  She asked for some extra to take home, she really enjoyed them.<br /><br />All the good Vitamin A content that you would normally find in a sweet potato has completely vanished in the processing of these, however.  I don't expect much from chips, I guess, still a bit disappointing.<br /><br />The bags are very thick, for a chip bag.  My 9 & 12 yr. old kids had trouble opening these, and resorted to scissors.  I should also mention that they are not fans of sweet potatoes, and did not care for these either.  That's ok - more for me!",

They taste too manufactured to us - the flavor is too intense.  We much prefer the basic original chip that remind us so much of Munchos.  They are nicely salty and have a great crunch.

I tried at least 6 different brands of popcorn-type snack packages (unfortunately, most came in 24-36 item packages).  After receiving the first 5 brands, I felt they were total waste of money.... 2 had texture of light styrofoam peanuts, with almost no flavor.  A couple others had reasonably nice flavor, BUT only had a couple small handfuls of popcorn in each bag so way overpriced and I definitely did not feel satisfied after 1 bag.<br /><br />Then I received the variety pack of PopChips.  I first tried the barbeque, which turned out to be my favorite.  They have nice strong bbq flavor, nice texture, and each bag has enough to feel satisfying.  The Original and Sour Cream and Onion came in lower second, but most of the others were just ok to fair- (not worth eating for my tastes but interesting).<br /><br />Best of all, the nutrition counts are good, with each bag only having 100 cals, 3 grams fat and 15g carbs (0 Cholesterol).<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product (and above flavors) over all the other popcorn types I tried.<br /><br />P.S.  PopCorners White Cheddar brand came in SECOND.  Nice crunchy texture and pleasant cheddar flavor",

    "review_text": "As I write this review, I'm looking at 3 large boxes of Popchips stacked in my living room.  I bought 2 of the 3 boxes, which each contain 24 bags of the chips.  One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.  The flavor isn't quite right, in my view.  My favorite flavor is barbecue followed by plain and the variety pack is a good way to figure out what you like the best.  But I cannot recommend Chili Lime Popchips.",

    "review_text": "I've never been a big fan on chips. When it comes to snack foods, I'm more of a pretzel guy, or maybe something cheesy. Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these \"chips\" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's \"good\" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again.",

    "review_text": "After a long absence, Senseo dark roast coffee pods are again available.  I had heard they are made by another company,not Sara Lee, so I wasn't sure they would taste the same. I ordered them again from Amazon.com (I was previously on their subscription plan, in which they would automatically send me a 6 pack every month, but then Amazon cancelled it--lack of supply from Sara Lee).<br /><br />Good news, the coffee is the same, delicious!  However, in the many months of absence of the Senseo pods (did they think I was going to stop drinking coffee and wait?  Lol, NO!), I found another brand that is comparable, just as good, but just about the same price:  Baronet dark roast makes pods that are also excellent coffee.  So if Senseo again stops production, I have another brand to fall back on. Bottom line, Senseo coffee is back, it's still delicious, but I don't trust them to stay in production, so I have Baronet as my back up plan.",

That is less than half (almost a third) of what you have to pay for a cup from a Keurig.<br />Able to make a single cup at a time, at a very reasonable price, and really like the Kona.

I read a tip somewhere on Amazon about wetting both sides of the pod and it was the best tip I got in 2008. The resulting coffee is rich and full flavored, without bitterness.

And although the unit has gone up to around $65. it is still a bargain in my opinion. I now purchse the Senseo Espresso monthly on Amazon and receive a 10-15% discount. A real bargain. Buy it.. you won't be dissapointed!",

It's no better than the cheap coffee in the can you get at any grocery store.  I like a full bodied dark cup of coffee, and that's what I used to get in the Senseo Dark Roast.  Now it tastes like dishwater.  I like brewing one cup at a time so I ordered the aftermarket filter insert so I can use ground coffee.  If it doesn't work as advirtised, I'll get a different coffee brewing system.<br /><br />I am so disappointed.  Why can't companies leave well enough alone.

The breakfast blend was really weak and tasted a little bit like wet cardboard or, as the Peanuts comic once said, like hot water with a brown crayon in it that needed more crayon.  I even used TWO pods for the smaller cup of coffee and it was still way too wimpy for me.  It still had the nice crema layer, it just had no taste.  I realize everyone has different coffee preferences.  But for someone who likes a stronger, more espresso-like coffee, I would tell them to steer clear of this roast.",

The taste took some getting used to and, while not awful, this is not a flavor I'll be going back to.  The chips have the same great Popchip texture however, they left a bit of an unpleasant after taste coating the back of my throat.  An after taste that lasted quite a while.<br /><br />Since everyone loves different flavors, I'm sure there will be folks that will love these, but for me, the Chili Lime flavor rated a 3.

    "review_text": "At 100 calories a bag these are a nice substitute for that afternoon craving of crunchy chips. The popchips give a nice satisfying crunch, and I would not have know they weren't fried. They have the nice mouth-feel of a fried chip, they don't taste baked or rice cracker-ish. The only off putting problem I had was these are really sweet. I don't mean sweet potato sweet, I mean eating a salty sugar cube sweet. I checked and the carb count isn't bad, there are only 2 grams of sugar, but these have a weird sweet taste and a strange after taste. If you like the sweet salty trend, the salted caramel or bacon sweets, you'll probably really like these, I prefer a more savory crunchy snack.",

    "review_text": "For those who have never tried Popchips before, they are not exactly a normal potato chip.  Popchips are air popped rather than fried.  They have a sort of puffy physical trait and kind of remind me of the Munchos chips I used to eat as a kid.  You still get the crunchy feeling of a chip, but they are just \"different\" than a regular potato chip.<br /><br />As a huge fan of barbecue Popchips, I was very anxious to try the Chili Lime flavor.  After the first few chips I ate, I didn't think there was much kick to it.  However, it seems like the more you eat, the spicier they get.  I didn't neccesarily taste the lime in it.  I would personally prefer a little sweetness to the chili flavor, which it didn't have, so maybe that's where the lime falls in.  Overall, these chips have a lot of flavor and are decently spicy.  They are now my 2nd favorite Popchips flavor behind the barbecue.  So, if you like a little spice in your chips, definitely try the chili lime variety.",

    "review_text": "NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're \"probably\" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a \"tomato\" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like \"Tomato and Basil\" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now.",

My sugar is high but I feel comfortable eating these in moderation since the carbs are lower than chips.<br /><br />  I originally bought the variety pack so I could try them all, and I liked them all although somewhat partial to the Cheddar. It's just a matter of what mood I am in as to which one I'll choose.<br /> Unfortunately they are a bit pricy if you don't get them on sale.

The flavor of the sweet potato is just right, mixed with a bit of saltiness - very tasty!

That made me extra happy!  There are plenty in the bag, too, unlike the small servings usually found in low-calorie snack packs.<br /><br />I shared these with a friend who came over one afternoon, since she also professed a love of sweet potatoes.  She asked for some extra to take home, she really enjoyed them.<br /><br />All the good Vitamin A content that you would normally find in a sweet potato has completely vanished in the processing of these, however.  I don't expect much from chips, I guess, still a bit disappointing.<br /><br />The bags are very thick, for a chip bag.  My 9 & 12 yr. old kids had trouble opening these, and resorted to scissors.

There's only 100 calories per bag and you actually get enough to feel satisfied.  We've tried the sweet potato and jalapeno flavors with less desirable results.  They taste too manufactured to us - the flavor is too intense.  We much prefer the basic original chip that remind us so much of Munchos.  They are nicely salty and have a great crunch.  They would make great crunchy toppings in recipes as opposed to breadcrumbs though I haven't tried anything beyond slipping a few onto my turkey sandwiches.  (Right, like you've never done it.)",

    "review_text": "I wanted to have \"sized\" portions of chip-type product that would be tasty and filling.  I tried at least 6 different brands of popcorn-type snack packages (unfortunately, most came in 24-36 item packages).  After receiving the first 5 brands, I felt they were total waste of money.... 2 had texture of light styrofoam peanuts, with almost no flavor.  A couple others had reasonably nice flavor, BUT only had a couple small handfuls of popcorn in each bag so way overpriced and I definitely did not feel satisfied after 1 bag.<br /><br />Then I received the variety pack of PopChips.  I first tried the barbeque, which turned out to be my favorite.  They have nice strong bbq flavor, nice texture, and each bag has enough to feel satisfying.  The Original and Sour Cream and Onion came in lower second, but most of the others were just ok to fair- (not worth eating for my tastes but interesting).<br /><br />Best of all, the nutrition counts are good, with each bag only having 100 cals, 3 grams fat and 15g carbs (0 Cholesterol).<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product (and above flavors) over all the other popcorn types I tried.<br /><br />P.S.  PopCorners White Cheddar brand came in SECOND.  Nice crunchy texture and pleasant cheddar flavor",

But they are truly addicting - I could only find them sporadically in my local grocery (HEB and Randalls both sold them, at least for a time), but once I found them here on Amazon, I started ordering them by the case and get to save money to boot.  These chips are not like regular chips - the texture is different, I assume from the \"popping,\" but once you taste them, you will become addicted, too! One of my all-time favorite snack foods!!",

Nonetheless I have eaten my share of potato chips over the years, and perhaps as a result I have been watching my weight lately.  I discovered these great popchips and they hit the spot in a number of ways.  First they are a low-calorie alternative to regular potato chips, meaning I can eat a normal-sized portion and still keep on target with my weight loss goals.  Second, they are gluten-free, which is great for those of us who have gluten intolerance issues.  Third, they taste great - light and airy, crispy, rich in that great potato flavor that keeps me reaching for another one.  This is a great product and I hope it stays around for a good long time.",

    "review_title": "Fantastic Crispy Airy Chips",
    "review_text": "Somewhere between a rice cake and a potato chip in texture, PopChips are an excellent low calorie snacking choice. I've tried all of the available flavors and here is my assessment of each:<br />Barbeque - A little too sweet for my taste but not bad overall<br />Jalapeno - High on Spice, not too salty, not much other flavor. I guess I was hoping for a cheesy jalapeno.<br />Original - Not super flavorful but great for dipping<br />Cheddar - Yummy<br />Parmesan Garlic - So Garlicky. Good but make for stinky breath<br />Salt & Pepper - Good<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar - If you like Vinegar you might like these but I wasn't as big of a fan of them as I expected<br />Sour Cream & Onion - Hands down the BEST flavor",

That's because they aren't baked or fried, just popped as their name suggests. These chips are very easy to dip as well. FANTASTIC PRODUCT!",

It has a sweet spiciness, but nothing is overpowering; just the right balance of smoke, sweet, and spice, they're all good, but the barbecue has the most robust flavor.<br /><br />Popchips are a good choice for those who are trying to trim a few pounds. They're tasty and filling, but relatively low in calories compared to traditional chips. I parcel mine out into sandwich-size reclosable bags to help with portion control, and still manage to have a satisfying snack that fits in my program.",

    "review_text": "As I write this review, I'm looking at 3 large boxes of Popchips stacked in my living room.  I bought 2 of the 3 boxes, which each contain 24 bags of the chips.  One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.  The flavor isn't quite right, in my view.  My favorite flavor is barbecue followed by plain and the variety pack is a good way to figure out what you like the best.  But I cannot recommend Chili Lime Popchips.",

    "review_text": "I've never been a big fan on chips. When it comes to snack foods, I'm more of a pretzel guy, or maybe something cheesy. Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these \"chips\" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's \"good\" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again.",

It's not greasy which surprised me. I thought it would be everywhere. It soaks right into your skin. In the reviews on QVC (I believe), there are women using this exact product on their face. That's just not my thing. I think the sweetness of the smell would bother my nose due to sensitivities to smells.

After a week or so of using it, i saw small black patches of what looked like mold on the surface of the surface. So I scraped it off. But within a couple of days, it grew back. I thought it was disgusting. Didn't want to throw such expensive oil away though. So I refrigerated it.  When refrigerated, the oil is hard as a brick. It's really difficult to scrape out chucks for use.  I mostly use this for pan frying eggs, veggies, meats, toast, etc.",

    "review_text": "Coconut oil is one of my favorite oils for cooking.  This particular brand has a mild flavor, at least compared to other brands I've tried, and is very reasonably priced.  It is also very stable (keeps well) and is cold pressed virgin.  I used to get this at Wild Oats in Denver, CO to use for stir fries and sautees.  It makes an INCREDIBLE Thai style curry -- you use this oil to fry the spices and vegetables, then simmer everything in coconut milk.  You get several layers of coconut flavor this way.  Plus, this is one of the best oils you can consume *period*.  It is so rich in HDL and other good fats it'll scrub your arteries clean in a month.  The coconut is a magical thing...there's a reason that coconut water can be used in an IV in place of saline for dehydration-- it's meant to be in your blood!",

    "review_title": "Fresh, flavorful, and hexane-free",
    "review_text": "I've tried a few different brands of extra-virgin coconut oil, and for the most part I'm equally satisfied with them all. Despite the marketing hype, coconut oil brands within each category (virgin, refined, hydrogenated) are very similar. I should specify the qualities I look for in a coconut oil: I want a coconut oil with a rich coconut aroma and taste, maximum nutrition, and minimal processing. For these reasons, I always select an organic, extra-virgin, cold-pressed oil.<br /><br />I'm pleased that this Nutiva Organic Extra-Virgin Coconut Oil provides these qualities along with an easy-to-find \"packed on\" and \"best before\" date. The jars I ordered in late January 2011 were packed on September 13, 2010, and the \"best before\" date is September 13, 2012. Stored correctly (cool, dark location, no refrigeration needed), this nutrient-dense oil stays fresh for two years. It smells and tastes great--coconutty and slightly sweet.<br /><br />According to Nutiva, no hexane is used in the processing of this oil. Hexane is a petroleum-derived solvent used in all kinds of industrial applications, from shoe manufacturing to roofing. Interestingly, because hexane's primary molecular structure is carbon, it can be passed off as \"organic.\" Do a little research; \"cold-pressed,\" \"organic,\" AND \"hexane-free\" are key considerations when selecting your coconut oil for nutrition purposes.<br /><br />I'm not as pleased with the plastic jars. In fact, I took off a star as a result of the plastic packaging. I feel that a quality organic oil should be stored in a glass jar, and ideally a dark one to reduce oxidation. I've actually selected coconut oils specifically because they come in glass jars, and might have bypassed this product if I hadn't found it on sale at a good price. I put this information in the review to aid those of you who are looking for a coconut oil in a glass jar.",

In fact, you can barely taste the coconut--it just adds a nice, mellow flavor to your food.<br /><br />My favorite thing to use it for is popcorn! I bought the Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper a few months ago, along with some Amish Country Popcorn, after a friend told me how great it was. YES! It makes the BEST popcorn (see my review for that for more details!) The oil melts nicely and quickly. It doesn't burn easily, so it's great for making foods that require high, fast heat.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product!<br /><br />PS- The popcorn is Wabash Valley Farms Amish Country Gourmet Popping Corn.",

    "review_title": "Smart and Savory",
    "review_text": "I used to cook with coconut oil years ago, but gave it up when the \"experts\" said it was bad for your health. I started cooking with \"healthier\" alternatives--like artificial sweeteners and chemical-loaded, aerosol-powered, partially hydrogenated cooking sprays--also on the advice of the experts.  My food tasted like a tin can, my skin was an oily mess, I felt sluggish all the time, and my jeans hugged me ever more tightly. Thankfully, the conventional wisdom has come full circle, and I've spent the last few years making the grateful journey back to a more natural--and genuinely healthy--way of living. I looked for a good, organic coconut oil at our regular grocer with no luck, so I was glad to find this brand here on Amazon.  I'll agree with some of the other reviewers that say this oil has a \"toasty\" scent.  It does, and that's why I like it.  Its warm, toasty aroma actually smells a little buttery--which is perfect if you're using this as a substitute for butter or margarine.  I've tried other oils that have a more coconut-y aroma, and they also had a sweeter, pronounced fruit-oil flavor that's great for desserts and dressings--but clashed with meats and savory dishes. This coconut oil and EVOO now get nearly equal time in my day-to-day cooking, and the warm \"toastiness\" of this oil adds a richness that enhances other flavors. I can't see it working in place of butter on something like toast or popcorn, but cooking with it gives a noticeably buttery taste to foods. This came in a pack of two tubs, which is convenient since this oil has so many uses. I can have one in the fridge to keep it solid for cosmetic/medicinal use, and the other in the cabinet as an ever-ready liquid for cooking. I'm once again enjoying all the benefits of virgin coconut oil--health, nutrition, beauty, and flavor all in one jar. These containers are fairly small, so if you use this as one of your staple oils, you may want to get a bigger size.",

    "review_title": "Excellent, Clean-Tasting Coconut Oil",
    "review_text": "First things first: the flavour of this coconut oil is wonderful. Very clean on the tongue with just a slight back hint of coconut flavour. YES, this WILL slightly flavour some of your dishes to taste faintly of coconut if the dish is not heavily spiced. When I use coconut oil in place of butter for many Ethiopian and Indian dishes, I don't really notice any coconut flavour--but these are heavily spiced cuisines and so the sheer level of spice involved will cover up the delicate coconut flavour of this oil. In baking, however, there is a wonderful little hint of it. When I've made cookies and cakes using this in place of shortening or butter, many people have commented that something felt different about the dessert, but they couldn't put their finger on it right away until I would suggest coconut. I say all of this, though, in case someone who absolutely HATES coconut is considering using coconut oil as a part of their diet. While it has many great health benefits, if you cannot stand the flavour of coconut in any shape or form, you probably will not enjoy this product. I personally enjoy the added depth and dimension is gives my food, as well as the fact it's cholesterol free.<br /><br />If you're thinking this wouldn't taste like anything, then you're thinking of what is called \"RBD coconut oil\", that is to say, coconut oil which has been refined, bleached, and deodorised. This is not that product, and in my opinion, is far superior to any RBD coconut oil you could find.<br /><br />Now, the health benefits. Coconut gets props for being cholesterol free. Many people want to downplay its wonderfulness by pointing out that it is loaded in saturated fats. However! The saturated fats found in coconut oil are mostly medium-chain fatty acids, which bind together to form medium-chain triglycerides. Medium-chain triglycerides, or MCTs, are much easier for the body to break down and process than long-chain triglycerides, which are the saturated fats that are usually predominant in our diets. Because MCTs are so easily broken down in the body, they don't put a great strain on your pancreas or digestive system. Coconut oil is not a cure-all, however. It's not some miracle food (IMO), but I do think it should be seen as a healthy, viable alternative to butter and some cooking oils. Should it replace these other oils and butter outright? No, I don't think so. But I think it deserves a place of respect alongside your butter and olive oil in the kitchen.",

    "review_text": "I wanted to try coconut oil after hearing about the health benefits.  In the winter, you don't need to worry about it spilling in shipment because it is solid below 76 degrees F.  I don't actually like shredded coconut but I love the taste of this coconut oil (guess I don't like the texture of coconut!).  I've only used it once so far, and that was to cook a Mexican-style fajita mix with vegetables (onion, garlic, peppers, tomato, and chile) and black beans.  There was a hint of the coconut flavor in the finished product, but it tasted really good!  I am trying to figure out how to eat more of this oil, but I will definitely use it in place of olive oil for sauteeing vegetables.  It is safe for cooking up to 350 degrees.  It melts quickly.  This is good quality coconut oil for a great price!  I bought it here on Amazon because I wanted to try it and the price was much cheaper than elsewhere online.",

Don't mistake healthy for bland tasting either, the coconut flavor actually enhances the dishes I cook. The oil is solid at room temp, it quickly turns to a liquid when heated. I also use this product as a leave in hair conditioner. This is no exaggeration when I say it works better than any commercial hair conditioner product I've tried. It works well as a facial moisturizer too. To use it on your face or hair, just put some of the oil in your palms, it will be solid so to liquefy it rub both palms together in a circular motion, after a few seconds you will have a natural, effective skin and haircare solution in the palm of your hands.",

    "review_title": "Near Perfect for popcorn, experimental for other things",
    "review_text": "Edit:  Added a second part.<br />===============================================<br />Original Post<br />I use this with the whirleypop, which I'm expecting to break any minute, but that aside, this makes near perfect popcorn.  The coconut taste is a little bit stronger than what you'd find in movie theatres but overall a bit bland (which is not a bad thing).  I frankly prefer that than trading the health benefits for overly processed oil.  That and while I love coconut trading the near tasteless flavor of the oil for a strong coconut flavor would reduce it's versatility in cooking.<br /><br />So when you salt this lightly with popcorn it stands on its own.  But I season mine with kernel's seasons, splenda, sugar, some salty butter flavoring along with melted Nutiva, mixed then drizzled on top.  In short, it's one step short of heaven and the switch from Canola is immediate and amazing.  I honestly can't stop eating it and it is rather healthy in comparison to movie theatre popcorn as I use far less and still has a very similar oil fragrance and taste.  Yes I still treat it like an oil and use about 2.5 to 3 tablespoons for a 1/3 cup of unpopped corn.<br /><br />On that note, while I applaud the brave reviewers out there who put this on their hair, and eat it religiously daily this is still an oil.  Perhaps a high quality one and one I may put on my split ends one day, but to me this is a yummy cooking oil you use in moderation.<br /><br />It also is a tad expensive (hence subbing a star) and again I do find it too bland to use alone on toasted bread (perhaps it has to be toasted together in the toaster oven) but the quality and convenience is really good.<br /><br />So if you happen to use it in other ways, good on you but I am happy with using it sparingly, and simply for popcorn.  It seems much more useful to me than using it as the latest and greatest in health fads today.  Especially because oil, even when healthy, contributes a hefty amount of calories and fat to your diet.<br /><br />==========================================================<br />Note about the Coconut Oil Hype<br /><br />Seems like a few people are very into the hype, so much so that if you do not write an overly glorifying review of coconut oil something is wrong with you.  I'm not a believer in ONLY scientific studies and if that were the case I would not care for reviews by buyers from amazon.  And frankly I love you reviwers as you save me time and money.  However I do have a limit on what I hear from the internet.  And whenever there is the word \"miracle\" attached to something in the title I use a heavy amount of skepticism.  And MANY people believe coconut and coconut oil is a \"miracle\".<br /><br />Sorry folks it isn't.  I do realize all the benefits of coconut water by the way. Coconut water is extremely healthy and even used as in emergencies to substitute for human blood, but even so I would hesitate to call coconut water a \"miracle\" as drinking it alone is not a cure for aids, cancer, etc. as suggested by some. That, to me would constitute a true miracle. And if it were true, coconuts would have been discovered a long time ago as a cure for aids/cancer, etc.<br /><br />Coconut water is undoubtedly good FOR you and I love coconuts as a whole but do use some discretion when eating OIL.<br /><br />To me, if you're thin, eating fat is not so much an issue when the fat is healthier and you probably need some caloric substance. Extra virgin coconut oil, while still being researched, comes from a coconut and thusly is inherently healthy to some degree. However, if you're already overweight, then eating 3 tablespoons of oil, ANY oil, on TOP of what you eat amounts to 390+ calories extra which means you gain a pound in only 10 days.  It is VERY easy to overeat oil and that said I would really hesitate to overuse coconut oil or any oil without extensive studies.<br /><br />So those reading what I wrote, as of March 3rd, 2011 coconut oil is still being heavily studied.  Just google it if the following links do not show.<br />[...]If you're on the fence, don't consider it (or anything for that matter) a miracle until long term studies ARE done.  If it's oil, keep in mind moderation is always the key.  Don't buy the hype to eat 3 tablespoons a day if you're already overweight.",

I have never used it as a replacement for butter or anything but I hear it tastes very good.

All in all, its a great price for a good product. Will probably only purchase if very cheap and on special on Amazon, otherwise there are several other brands that come to mind that I will use more regularly due to glass jar like Tropical Traditions which tastes amazing and is my favourite coconut oil! :) But for the price I got it for I was happy.",

This oil is a WONDERFUL moisturizer, and I use it every time I wash my hair - sometimes between washes, if it's an extended time. My hair has never felt so healthy and... not-dry.

The consensus seems to be that it has a smoother texture and stronger coconut flavor. So if you're eating it by the spoonful or spreading it on toast or want a shot in your smoothie, that would be the way to go, if you don't mind paying a little more.<br /><br />I'm mostly using coconut oil for cooking, so I like the more subtle fragrance of Nutiva. I can use it for most anything that calls for canola oil without everything tasting of coconut--mostly it just adds a certain savory quality, like umami, and makes your kitchen smell amazing.<br /><br />It's also great as a deep-conditioning treatment for hair. I leave it in for a few hours and my hair feels soft and unprocessed after washing it out with my regular shampoo. I love it because it changes the texture of my hair without weighing it down.",

I'm not sure if the ingredients are cooked but the oil has a burnt horrid taste to it.  Before we realized it, we had made a batch of carb-free chocolate candy with cream cheese and coconut frosting, a huge batch of chicken fried in the oil and a huge batch of faux-potatoes using the oil.  We had to throw everything away.  The taste was atrocious.  Everything had a burnt and bitter taste to it.  I'm extremely disappointed and according to my 15 year old daughter, they need to hire better quality control employees.<br /><br />I have to post an update to this review because I've been working with a customer service rep today and he has provided fantastic service.

I have found that when coconut oil liquefies in hot weather some of the oil seeps through the bottom of the jar. I think it might be due to the process in which they make their new opaque plastic jars. There is a line in the middle where the two parts of plastic where joined together or where the plastic was molded and separated from the mold.  At the bottom of the jar the oil leaks through this mold line. In summer temperatures I have found some residual oil left at the bottom of the surface where I leave the jar.

Nutiva has a clean, lightly coconut scented product with good prices for the size. It's organic and cold pressed so heat hasn't rendered away any antioxidants and benefits. I use it like butter on bagels, and for my cooking oil. I use olive oil for salads because coconut oil is a solid under about 70 to 75. I also use it for oil pulling for dental health. I mildly dislike the plastic container but I've read that the grade is good and won't leach chemicals into the contents.",

    "review_text": "I bought this coconut oil based solely on other great customer reviews and believe me when I tell you how happy I am that I did! I am 39 years old and at the age where health is something that is starting to become very important to me, as I am starting to see more and more friends and school mates with various health issues.. I have never had any health complaints and have decided to be proactive about health matters, instead of trying to \"fix\" them as they come along (as long as I'm able, of course). So, in my hours and hours of reading, I came across so many articles, websites and books devoted to coconut oil. I was shocked, that I have never heard of it and I have still not met anyone who uses it.<br /><br />So, I decided I had to try it! The main reason was I read that eating 2-4 teaspoons a day had health benefits, but I have also came across my fair share of home spa recipes for moisturizers using coconut oil as one of there main ingredients. I figured, I couldn't go wrong buying it, because if it didn't taste nice, I could still use it. I'm very happy to report that I was blown away by the taste of this coconut oil! It is not sweet at all but the coconut oil was so reminiscent of a Almond Joy candy bar to me, that I find myself going back for another spoon just to enjoy the delicious flavor..  I'm afraid I'm going to have to reorder more to use in my moisturizer recipes, as I intend to use these two containers to cook with now that I am hooked on this fantastic product.! I would recommend this coconut oil to everyone because of it's many health benefits and versatility of use (You can spread it on your toast it tastes so great or cook with it as you would any cooking oil, as well as use it on your skin. Google Coconut oil moisturizer recipes, cooking recipes and also health benefits for yourself as well as the  health benefits for your dogs if you have pets. You will be amazed at all the interesting information on the web about coconut oil))! Unless you truly dislike coconuts I think you will find, like me, that you now have a new favorite oil!",

It may have cholesterol in it, but it must have other properties that are more beneficial, because my husband's cholesterol levels are in check for the first time in 10 years!  This brand of raw coconut oil is a very good one and we enjoy it a lot - it smells faintly of coconut, but it doesn't have a strong coconut flavor... we use it for frying eggs, in sautes, stir fry, even as a butter replacement on toast with raw honey (yum!)  The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that the containers had oil on the outside, which I was able to clean off fairly easy, but it was kind of a mess.",

    "review_title": "Excellent Product, The Best Oil You Can Use",
    "review_text": "The health benefits of coconut oil have been reported widely by now. I now live in a place where there are more coconuts than people, but I brought the Nutiva Coconut Oil down here with me, because it's almost 10 dollars for half a liter here.<br /><br />I have found this brand to be the purest coconut oil on the market, at least among those I've been able to find and try. The price is fabulous, can't beat it.<br /><br />The oil will solidify at lower temperatures, it did that often when I lived in Texas. You just scoop it out and use it the same way. Once it sits in a room temp over 70 degrees, it tends to stay clear and in its liquid form. It hasn't solidified at all since I've been in subtropical Mexico. It's not white when in liquid form.<br /><br />I avoid all artificial fats and use coconut and extra virgen olive oil for most cooking and baking now. I have no problem with natural fats as I follow a mostly low-carb diet nowadays, but I still prefer non-animal sources for most fat. The fact that coconut oil has been shown to aid with lowering blood sugar is a big plus for me. I know a lot of people who stir it into their coffee or find other ways to ingest at least 3TB per day, I probably don't get that much, though I know I should.<br /><br />Be aware that this oil doesn't taste much like coconut, important for me because I LOATHE the flavor of coconut. It does smell like it, but I haven't found that it adds any taste at all to what I cook.<br /><br />A caveat: coconut oil has a smoke point that's about as low as olive oil, I believe it's 350 to 375 degrees, so this is not an oil that's suitable for deep-frying. You'll have to stick with peanut oil for that.<br /><br />I've had the second jar open for about 5 months now on the counter and have not noticed any degradation of the smell or cooking results for this oil. It should last quite well when stored unopened, as well.<br /><br />You can also use this as a moisturizer, I've tried it and it does leave my skin VERY soft.",

    "review_title": "Great Stuff for a Number of Things",
    "review_text": "I was almost put off using coconut oil entirely, after purchasing another brand (I think NOW was it, but different packaging). It came hard as a rock, yellow-looking and smelled pretty foul (almost sickly-sweet) - certainly nothing like coconut. I literally was chipping it out of the jar, and melting it was near impossible. Eventually, I realized that I was dealing with rancid oil, so it's pretty fortunate that I didn't use it all that often. Yuck.<br /><br />After watching a view Youtube videos for hair care, I noticed everyone's was white, creamy and you could easily scoop it out of the jar, so I decided to give it another shot and purchased Nutiva in February 2011. I'm so glad I did, too, because this stuff is great and for a number of things, some of which caught me off guard.<br /><br />- Cooking -<br />I enjoy cooking with it now and then, especially with my quick-fix quesadillas when I don't have time to cook anything else. However, it doesn't work on everything due to the subtle yet nutty flavor it can give, but I do like it for frying. Your place will smell like coconut when you fry with it, as a warning. I do love how fast it heats up, though.<br /><br />- Hair -<br />I originally intended to use this for hair and as a deep conditioning mask. I am biracial, with 3A/3b and a tinge of 3C hair. While I usually prefer to have it relaxed, I decided to give it a break due to lack of funds. The hard water we have here has been wreaking havoc on my hair and it's been in need of a trim for a while, but this stuff has greatly improved things, and it even can be used (lightly) to help tame frizz to some degree as a leave-in. My ringlets are back and the best-looking they've been since I can remember, and all I've been using since then is just Aphogee Green Tea spray, coconut oil and occasional argan oil.<br /><br />- Skin -<br />I consistently use this on my body and at night as skin cream. For the face, you only need a tiny, tiny amount. It also helps to tame down blemishes, which is a bonus, and leaves skin glowy. Last year or the year before, I also developed what looked like flesh-colored moles, which I thought were blemishes at first, but I can't be certain. Nothing I did would get rid of them though, until I started using the oil, which I found odd, but at least it worked! All in all, my skin has dramatically improved using this, with the help of some other products, and I don't feel I have to wear foundation.<br /><br />- Pets -<br />I give 1/2 tbls. to my cats and 1 tbls. to my dog a few times a week to help maintain their coats and keep their skin nice. It seems to be doing great and they've stopped driving me mental with scratching. I also tried it in hopes of helping my dog with her seizures. While it's not a drastic improvement, they have been fewer in between, which may or may not have a connection. I just mix it in their food maybe 2-3 days a week (ask your vet about how often, especially if they have health problems), and they love it. Even my female cat, who's picky about what she'll eat licks at the oil before she munches away.<br /><br />- Warts -<br />Short of the suspicious-looking things on my face at one point, I don't get moles, warts, or even freckles. However, I did get one whopping wart on the top of my big toe last year, which nothing would get rid of. I tried apple cider vinegar, wart patches and gels - you name it; I tried it. Not only did it hurt like crazy and work slowly, but it never got rid of it. All I did get was a scar and a lot of grief, only for it to return a few weeks later.<br /><br />When I started using coconut oil on the skin, I realized one day, like with my face, that my wart that had grown back was getting smaller. I kept watching it and finally realized the connection. I started using bandaids and applied a glob of oil on the spot before bed and then really started noticing results. This wart was the size of a chick pea (sorry to be gross lol), but now you can't see anything.<br /><br />I finally looked things up and realized that it was the acid in the oil that attacks lipid-coated virus cells, such as what's associated with HPV (warts), so I guess it makes sense. I was surprised though! I can tell due to the texture of the skin that it's not 100% gone (roots), but it still getting better and I'm not embarrassed anymore. It took about a month, but the more painful options took just as long and this is pain-free. So, it's something to try!<br /><br />Love this stuff and can't stop raving about it. I'm going to purchase more soon in this size to keep one in my kitchen and one in my bathroom again, plus a larger one for the mutts. The bathroom one still has plenty in it, despite me using it near-daily.",

The moisturizer I was using felt kind of scummy on my face after I added my foundation and I was having troubles with facial redness and dry patches. I was also having heat rash problems in my underarm area. I started using just a little of the coconut oil on my face in place of my moisturizer, then applying my foundation and wow! What a difference! My skin has cleared up and I love the soft smooth way my face feels. My foundation spreads and blends much better.  Also, the coconut oil really helps with the heat rash, immediately soothing the discomfort. I like using this as a hand cream too. I look forward to seeing how well it works this winter when the air is much drier.<br /><br />I have done a little cooking with it, but not enough yet to have an opinion.<br /><br />Other folks have mentioned that the oil leaked during shipment. I was concerned about this since I ordered it during the summer. I ordered 4 tubs (2 pks of 2 tubs). The plastic containers arrived packed in plastic bags, 2 tubs/bag, within the box. Even though the lids felt pretty tight on the tubs, both of the plastic bags had some coconut oil that had leaked, but not enough to feel cheated. A little oil leaked out of the plastic bags into the box, but they were the only things packed in the box so nothing was ruined. I can see that if the lids had been any looser though, there would have been a mess. Oil is hard to keep in a container with a wide mouth like this.<br /><br />One more thing...I absolutely love the smell of this stuff. It has a light roasted coconut essence which isn't too strong and doesn't linger overly long, but long enough to enjoy for a short while while it is being absorbed by the skin. Yum!",

I read a lot about different oils people use, but one thing was always the same, if you want it to taste like at the movies use coconut oil.<br /><br />I found the texture in the jar to be harder then I thought (though it may have been a bit frozen from outside in the box).  It definitely smells like coconut, like a mounds bar.  I was so concerned about the popcorn tasting like nothing but coconut.  I was VERY surprised buy the wonderful taste it gives the popcorn, I can't believe I never realized at the movies that the reason the popcorn taste so good is that bit of coconut flavor to it.  It also left my popcorn machine very clean, when the other oil coated the whole machine in a greasy gunk. Combine with Eden Organics Organic popcorn kernels from Amazon for a total organic popcorn.",

    "review_text": "In general, I love Popchips.  (BBQ are my absolute favs.)  These are the chips I go for automatically at the store because of their crisp texture and great taste.<br /><br />This review is for the Chili Lime Popchips.<br /><br />They have a little heat for the Chili and a bit of acid for the Lime, however, I must admit that these are not my favorite.  The taste took some getting used to and, while not awful, this is not a flavor I'll be going back to.  The chips have the same great Popchip texture however, they left a bit of an unpleasant after taste coating the back of my throat.  An after taste that lasted quite a while.<br /><br />Since everyone loves different flavors, I'm sure there will be folks that will love these, but for me, the Chili Lime flavor rated a 3.  Not awful.  Not great.  Not on my shopping list.",

You still get the crunchy feeling of a chip, but they are just \"different\" than a regular potato chip.<br /><br />As a huge fan of barbecue Popchips, I was very anxious to try the Chili Lime flavor.  After the first few chips I ate, I didn't think there was much kick to it.  However, it seems like the more you eat, the spicier they get.  I didn't neccesarily taste the lime in it.  I would personally prefer a little sweetness to the chili flavor, which it didn't have, so maybe that's where the lime falls in.  Overall, these chips have a lot of flavor and are decently spicy.  They are now my 2nd favorite Popchips flavor behind the barbecue.  So, if you like a little spice in your chips, definitely try the chili lime variety.",

I recently bought 12 bags of Cheddar on Amazon!<br />These are much better than those baked chips out on the market (in my opinion). Oh, and an FYI, these are way better than rice cakes-people keep comparing the two and I totally disagree).<br />The 0.8 oz bag is perfect single size (pretty generous actually).<br />Yummy!",

    "review_title": "Taste more like \"Tomato and Basil\" than \"Chili and Lime\"",
    "review_text": "NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're \"probably\" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a \"tomato\" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like \"Tomato and Basil\" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now.",

I love potato chips but they are loaded with lots of unhealthy things. I'm not saying these are healthy, just a lot less unhealthy than chips.<br /><br /> For starters these are all natural with very little fat and fairly low in carbs for a food of this type. My sugar is high but I feel comfortable eating these in moderation since the carbs are lower than chips.<br /><br />  I originally bought the variety pack so I could try them all, and I liked them all although somewhat partial to the Cheddar. It's just a matter of what mood I am in as to which one I'll choose.<br /> Unfortunately they are a bit pricy if you don't get them on sale. I just wish these came in a larger bag as opposed to the individual servings which are always more expensive.<br /><br /> Everyone has a different idea of good, so this is something you are going to have to try for yourself to decide.",

Of course I really enjoy rice cakes as well and these are similar in taste \"weight\" but the texture is more like maybe a thick (yet still light) Munchos, or maybe like a flattened out pork rind.  Like I said however, these are not for everyone.  My husband really doesn't like them much.  So far he only sort-of likes the Salt & Pepper.

Just the right balance of sweet and salty.  Portion controlled bags have only a 100 calories and 95 mg of sodium.  These are definitely a healthier alternative to potato chips.  But don't mistake \"healthier\" for \"healthy.\"  They have almost no nutritional value (1 g protein, 2% iron).  So don't let all the buzzwords on the packaging fool you.  Still, if you are looking for a light snack that won't ruin your diet, this is a good choice.  As an FYI, despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe, sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.  Rice flour is the first ingredient, followed by sweet potato flakes, tapioca starch, a blend of various oils, corn flour, seasonings, etc. Not a huge deal, but its one of those \"truth in advertising\" points that annoys me so I mention it.",

The flavor of the sweet potato is just right, mixed with a bit of saltiness - very tasty!  Just the right amount of light crunch, more like popcorn.<br /><br />At 100 calories per bag, these fit right into my eating plan that allows two 100-150 calorie snacks per day.  That made me extra happy!  There are plenty in the bag, too, unlike the small servings usually found in low-calorie snack packs.<br /><br />I shared these with a friend who came over one afternoon, since she also professed a love of sweet potatoes.  She asked for some extra to take home, she really enjoyed them.<br /><br />All the good Vitamin A content that you would normally find in a sweet potato has completely vanished in the processing of these, however.  I don't expect much from chips, I guess, still a bit disappointing.<br /><br />The bags are very thick, for a chip bag.  My 9 & 12 yr. old kids had trouble opening these, and resorted to scissors.

A couple others had reasonably nice flavor, BUT only had a couple small handfuls of popcorn in each bag so way overpriced and I definitely did not feel satisfied after 1 bag.<br /><br />Then I received the variety pack of PopChips.  I first tried the barbeque, which turned out to be my favorite.  They have nice strong bbq flavor, nice texture, and each bag has enough to feel satisfying.  The Original and Sour Cream and Onion came in lower second, but most of the others were just ok to fair- (not worth eating for my tastes but interesting).<br /><br />Best of all, the nutrition counts are good, with each bag only having 100 cals, 3 grams fat and 15g carbs (0 Cholesterol).<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product (and above flavors) over all the other popcorn types I tried.<br /><br />P.S.

These chips are not like regular chips - the texture is different, I assume from the \"popping,\" but once you taste them, you will become addicted, too! One of my all-time favorite snack foods!!",

    "review_text": "I love potato chips.  I could eat them by the bagful but thanks to the powers that be, this would not provide anyone with enough nutrition to survive.  Nonetheless I have eaten my share of potato chips over the years, and perhaps as a result I have been watching my weight lately.  I discovered these great popchips and they hit the spot in a number of ways.  First they are a low-calorie alternative to regular potato chips, meaning I can eat a normal-sized portion and still keep on target with my weight loss goals.  Second, they are gluten-free, which is great for those of us who have gluten intolerance issues.  Third, they taste great - light and airy, crispy, rich in that great potato flavor that keeps me reaching for another one.  This is a great product and I hope it stays around for a good long time.",

One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.  The flavor isn't quite right, in my view.  My favorite flavor is barbecue followed by plain and the variety pack is a good way to figure out what you like the best.

I haven't tried other flavors, but Original works just fine for me because I use it for various dips and will even use dry seasonings on them if I'm in the mood.<br /><br />I don't know anybody that I've offered some of these to who didn't want a bag of their own!  Highly recommended.",

    "review_text": "I've never been a big fan on chips. When it comes to snack foods, I'm more of a pretzel guy, or maybe something cheesy. Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these \"chips\" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's \"good\" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again.",

The taste took some getting used to and, while not awful, this is not a flavor I'll be going back to.  The chips have the same great Popchip texture however, they left a bit of an unpleasant after taste coating the back of my throat.  An after taste that lasted quite a while.<br /><br />Since everyone loves different flavors, I'm sure there will be folks that will love these, but for me, the Chili Lime flavor rated a 3.

You still get the crunchy feeling of a chip, but they are just \"different\" than a regular potato chip.<br /><br />As a huge fan of barbecue Popchips, I was very anxious to try the Chili Lime flavor.  After the first few chips I ate, I didn't think there was much kick to it.  However, it seems like the more you eat, the spicier they get.  I didn't neccesarily taste the lime in it.  I would personally prefer a little sweetness to the chili flavor, which it didn't have, so maybe that's where the lime falls in.  Overall, these chips have a lot of flavor and are decently spicy.  They are now my 2nd favorite Popchips flavor behind the barbecue.  So, if you like a little spice in your chips, definitely try the chili lime variety.",

    "review_title": "Taste more like \"Tomato and Basil\" than \"Chili and Lime\"",
    "review_text": "NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're \"probably\" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a \"tomato\" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like \"Tomato and Basil\" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now.",

My sugar is high but I feel comfortable eating these in moderation since the carbs are lower than chips.<br /><br />  I originally bought the variety pack so I could try them all, and I liked them all although somewhat partial to the Cheddar. It's just a matter of what mood I am in as to which one I'll choose.<br /> Unfortunately they are a bit pricy if you don't get them on sale.

The Salt & Pepper are VERY peppery.  More Pepper than Salt, but I really enjoy the savory bite these have.  I really enjoy the texture of these as well.  Of course I really enjoy rice cakes as well and these are similar in taste \"weight\" but the texture is more like maybe a thick (yet still light) Munchos, or maybe like a flattened out pork rind.  Like I said however, these are not for everyone.  My husband really doesn't like them much.  So far he only sort-of likes the Salt & Pepper.

Just the right balance of sweet and salty.  Portion controlled bags have only a 100 calories and 95 mg of sodium.  These are definitely a healthier alternative to potato chips.  But don't mistake \"healthier\" for \"healthy.\"  They have almost no nutritional value (1 g protein, 2% iron).  So don't let all the buzzwords on the packaging fool you.  Still, if you are looking for a light snack that won't ruin your diet, this is a good choice.  As an FYI, despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe, sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.  Rice flour is the first ingredient, followed by sweet potato flakes, tapioca starch, a blend of various oils, corn flour, seasonings, etc. Not a huge deal, but its one of those \"truth in advertising\" points that annoys me so I mention it.",

The flavor of the sweet potato is just right, mixed with a bit of saltiness - very tasty!  Just the right amount of light crunch, more like popcorn.<br /><br />At 100 calories per bag, these fit right into my eating plan that allows two 100-150 calorie snacks per day.  That made me extra happy!  There are plenty in the bag, too, unlike the small servings usually found in low-calorie snack packs.<br /><br />I shared these with a friend who came over one afternoon, since she also professed a love of sweet potatoes.  She asked for some extra to take home, she really enjoyed them.<br /><br />All the good Vitamin A content that you would normally find in a sweet potato has completely vanished in the processing of these, however.  I don't expect much from chips, I guess, still a bit disappointing.<br /><br />The bags are very thick, for a chip bag.  My 9 & 12 yr. old kids had trouble opening these, and resorted to scissors.

A couple others had reasonably nice flavor, BUT only had a couple small handfuls of popcorn in each bag so way overpriced and I definitely did not feel satisfied after 1 bag.<br /><br />Then I received the variety pack of PopChips.  I first tried the barbeque, which turned out to be my favorite.  They have nice strong bbq flavor, nice texture, and each bag has enough to feel satisfying.  The Original and Sour Cream and Onion came in lower second, but most of the others were just ok to fair- (not worth eating for my tastes but interesting).<br /><br />Best of all, the nutrition counts are good, with each bag only having 100 cals, 3 grams fat and 15g carbs (0 Cholesterol).<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product (and above flavors) over all the other popcorn types I tried.<br /><br />P.S.

    "review_text": "PopChips are the best potato chips I have ever had, hands down. The BBQ flavor is strong and tangy. The calories and fat are very low. No frying, so the chips are very healthy - at least for a chip. You can satisfy that salt and crunch craving with these, no problem. But they are truly addicting - I could only find them sporadically in my local grocery (HEB and Randalls both sold them, at least for a time), but once I found them here on Amazon, I started ordering them by the case and get to save money to boot.  These chips are not like regular chips - the texture is different, I assume from the \"popping,\" but once you taste them, you will become addicted, too! One of my all-time favorite snack foods!!",

Nonetheless I have eaten my share of potato chips over the years, and perhaps as a result I have been watching my weight lately.  I discovered these great popchips and they hit the spot in a number of ways.  First they are a low-calorie alternative to regular potato chips, meaning I can eat a normal-sized portion and still keep on target with my weight loss goals.  Second, they are gluten-free, which is great for those of us who have gluten intolerance issues.  Third, they taste great - light and airy, crispy, rich in that great potato flavor that keeps me reaching for another one.  This is a great product and I hope it stays around for a good long time.",

One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.  The flavor isn't quite right, in my view.  My favorite flavor is barbecue followed by plain and the variety pack is a good way to figure out what you like the best.  But I cannot recommend Chili Lime Popchips.",

    "review_text": "I've never been a big fan on chips. When it comes to snack foods, I'm more of a pretzel guy, or maybe something cheesy. Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these \"chips\" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's \"good\" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again.",

I am one of \"those\" owners that allows their dogs to have food in their bowls at all times so if the nine days seems short, that is why.  My dogs are huge; a husky and a chow/shepherd mix and they are outside dogs so having plenty of water and food at all times is what they are used to.  Both dogs seemed to enjoy eating the product and I tried to watch for any ill effects (stomach wise, etc) and saw nothing out of the ordinary.  When the dogs ate, they ate for about ten minutes and seemed to be full for a long time.  The dog food has nice ingredients and while corn is still a big by product of the food, my dogs seemed to find it tasty and they ate this dog food better than the dog food I have been feeding them for years. LOL<br /><br />I would buy it again; the price is a bit higher than some and less expensive than Iams.  Between the two, I would buy Beneful every time.<br /><br />Natalie S. for Amazon Vine",

He really chows down on this Beneful dog food though. It had different sized and different shaped pieces, some soft and some crunchy. However, I don't think he noticed the various textures at all. He's a big dog and eats a couple scoops a day. We didn't do a subtle switch by mixing more and more of the new food in with his old, we just started feeding him the new food in his usual portion. He did not have any dietary problems with the straight switch. Everything was normal.<br /><br />What I really like about this dog food is the packaging. With other dog foods, we have to tear apart the bag and poor the food into another container with a lid. Beneful has a Ziploc-type closure. I don't have to transfer the food and I can squeeze the extra air out of the bag as it empties so that the food will stay fresher. Beneful is a win-win; my dog and I both like it.",

He was pretty bored of his other food, the only dog I know to leave the bowl half full after feedings and walk away.  But this stuff, he just gobbles it up!  I know some of the other reviews bash it for not being all meat and a lot of corn meal products, but I don't have the budget to spend money on expensive dog food and buy him all meat or organic dog foods or feed him better than I eat myself.  I also trust the Purina brand as through the years it has never been one of the dog foods to ever be recalled.  I am not saying this because I got free dogfood to sample, Amazon sent this to me not Purina, but as a loyal Purina customer.  When I had my siamese cat before my dog (who is now five), that's all I ever bought him was Purina, too.  Anyways, my doxie loves this Beneful better than his old Purina mix so we will definitly be sticking to it for now!  I also love the bag itself which is resealable.  I personally have a tote that we store our food in since they didn't used to have sealable bags, so we just dumped it in there and mixed his old food in there so his tummy could adjust anyways, but I thought it was worth mentioning as I thought that was a cool plus!  Highly recommended.  Sure, there is better food out there, healthier, meatier, more organic.  And sure, your dog deserves better if you can afford it.  I can't.  I give my dog my steak scraps sometimes and he's not complaining, he's happy with this mix and chasing squirrels and rabbits, and my wallet will be happy too.  :)",

Then we get to wheat flour, animal fat, and rice flour.  Hmmm.  And what is \"animal digest\"?  Vitamins, carrots, and peas do show up later in the list, but so do Red 40, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, and Blue 2, all for human viewing pleasure, not our dogs' nutrition.  The packaging looks great, showing chunks of fresh beef, fresh peas, carrots, and corn.  But  I think we will stick with our tried and true, high-quality dog food, as opposed to this well-packaged and highly marketed dog food.",

I can't tell you how many times I've brought something home for the 4th member of our family , and although initial excitement was encouraging , it soon waned. So I was tentative to try Purina Beneful , as let's face it , it kinda resides on the costly end of the spectrum.<br />Couldn't be happier ! Or should I say Bonzo couldn't be happier!

Once we put them on Beneful, they have had healthier digestion and healthier skin and coat.  They really love the chunks and they are medium sized dogs but for small breeds you'd want to get smaller kibble size.  I love that it is in a big resealable bag so I can just scoop out what I need and then close it back up.  Both of our dogs have eaten Beneful for a couple of years and always get good reports at their vet checkups.  It costs a little more than store brand dog food but you really are getting a much higher quality product.  My pups love it so much that they've learned to carry their bowl around in their teeth until I get the point and refill the bowl so they must like it.  I will continue to buy it and recommend.

    "review_text": "I was suprised when this arrived, it was a huge 15lb bag.  I thought for some reason it would be a small sample bag.  The bag is large and attractive with a heavy ziplock top.<br /><br />The food inside is multi sized and colorful but way too big for my Chihuahua's to eat.  Also, I worry about all that extra dye in the food. Dogs can't see color, so the company is making the food look appetizing solely for the human owner. I picked out some of the smaller pieces of kibble but neither dog nor the cats were interested..hmmmmmmmm. While my animals usually eat \"Taste of the Wild\" food, I know the dogs are picky eats but the cats eat everything, including bugs so it was a little weird they wouldn't touch it.<br /><br />I decided to have a look at the ingredients-it was mostly corn.  One cat will eat corn of the cob so perhaps if I had wet it down he would have eaten it LOL.  On a serious note, corn as a main ingredient isn't really too \"beneficial\" to the health of a dog. I suppose this food is better quality than a lot of grocery store dog foods but it really as \"healthy\" as the advertising would make you think it was.  Not a bad food but not the best either. It's a shame-all the advertising and makeing the food look pretty but not spending that $$ on making it good for the dogs.<br /><br />Rather than throw away 15 lbs of perfectly good food, I found a local animal rescue that happily wanted the donation of the bag of food.",

They both scoffed it up enthusiastically, and both the dogs owners had heard of, and in the past have used Beneful before.  The other reviews here seem to be about equally divided as to it either not being as nutritionally balanced as promised, or, have some serious questions or comments about some of the other things in it.  I'm afraid I can't be much help as to much of that.  But what I will say it seems to have a whole lot more going for it than a lot of the store brands that are popular with folks nowadays. In fact its loaded compared to some of those. The dog people I know all seem to like Beneful.  It's more of a question of its cost more than its nutritional concerns it appears.  My recommendation comes from the dogs point of view of it being very tasty and appreciated.  And my suggestion as to its nutrition and by products is to compare this with the big box store brands that many are used to, read the other reviews here, and then decide if the extra cost is worth it.  It's a crowd pleaser in my house for sure..: )",

Our dog is small (about 9 lbs) and has no trouble with the size of the kibble in this variety. And a bag this size lasts quite a while. Ideally we could all eat like kings, even dogs, but until then, this is a reasonable, practical solution to \"what to feed the dog?\"",

However, I won't be buying it for him, even if he thought it were the best thing on the planet. Corn as its first and main ingredient tells me a lot about the nutrition. Sure, dogs are omnivores, but they're not meant to eat diets THAT high in grains!<br /><br />I also find the \"Beneful\" name and its description of the product to be misleading. The name of the product suggests that it's healthier than other dog foods, but anyone feeding this to their dog would have about the same health benefits (or lack thereof) as any other non-premium dog food<br /><br />It passed my dog's taste test in that he eats it, and it doesn't make him sick, hence the rating of more than one star. My response is after reading the ingredient list was to start mixing it with his regular, premium dog foods, which are healthier... like his grain free products. That eliminates the other stars.<br /><br />The health of my pets is paramount. My last dog, an 85 lbs pound pup (we THINK a Shiloh shepherd or a Malamute / Belgian Tervuren mix), lived to 18 years on the premium dog foods I fed him and his home-made jerky treats where I use extra lean ground meat (usually turkey), jerky seasonings, and Dog Bloom VM Supreme dog vitamins (powdered, with real cheddar cheese powder to give it added flavor).",

Jeff (the Bassett) has never had any digestive issues from this food. So as a dog owner, I am happy with a food that Jeff likes and is good for him.<br /><br />The Beneful I received from Amazon had added bonus that I REALLY loved: a heavy duty ziplock zipper on the top of the bag.  Even with only a few cups taken out of the bag, it was sealed tight. Super convenient.<br /><br />Purina is a 5-star dog food for my dog.

True to prediction, my dog was not interested in this particular dog food.  My dog is about 15 lbs and the food, if she likes it, would a type that she could easily consumed as the pieces are not overly large. When I provided her with a bowl of the food, she licked it and picked out a couple of pieces, rolled over the pieces, and then proceeded to look at me like I was a bad owner.

    "review_text": "UPDATE: My dog has a \"nervous tummy\" and you never know what will upset her. Blue Buffalo (a very good quality food) absolutely did not agree with her. I also tried Beaver Dam. I tried various foods, made my own blend, and of all the foods, this one agrees well with her system. Yes, it's not the top meat ingredients (by-product meal and corn, both considered poor quality.) But she's thriving and growing on this food. Go figure. I like the resealable bag. Remember to seal it however. The cat crawled inside the bag once, and I found him, how many minutes (hours?) completely inside, munching in a coma of bliss. No harm done, either (not recommended however for cats. Mine is a stray and a glutton of astonishing capacity.)<br /><br />This is a nice soft kibble dog food that has an aroma of fresh vegetables when you open the bag. So it really does have a variety of ingredients to nourish the dog.<br /><br />However, the first three ingredients are of concern: corn, chicken by product meal and corn gluten meal. Some dogs are sensitive to corn and chicken by-product meal is ground up chicken carcases and offal (innards and bones with any attached meat) and is less digestible than chicken meat. For example, I feed my dog a mix of offal (gizzards, livers and hearts) ground up or mixed with chicken thigh.<br /><br />Corn is a debatable ingredient. It is cheap. (So is chicken by-product meal.) It is possible allergenic and certainly less digestible than rice. If your dog can digest it, it may be ok (though there is some feeling corn is involved in various dog diseases like diabetes and obesity. The corn helps the kibbling process (it's starchy.)<br /><br />Bottom line: top three ingredients are cheap ingredients and your dog may not benefit. Some dogs get allergies and skin irritations from corn. My dog enjoys this and when I'm not making dog mash (with brown rice, turkey thigh and green beans and supplements) this is what she eats. She loves it. For grocery store dog food, it isn't bad.<br /><br />Ingredients: Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, whole wheat flour, beef tallow preserved with mixed-tocopherols (source of vitamin E), rice flour, beef, soy flour, sugar, sorbitol, tricalcium phosphate, water, animal digest, salt, phosphoric acid, potassium chloride, dicalcium phosphate, sorbic acid (a preservative), l-lysine monohydrochloride, dried peas, dried carrots, calcium carbonate, calcium propionate (s preservative), choline chloride, vitamin supplements (E, A, B12, D3),",

So I suppose if you have a finicky dog then Beneful might be something to consider.<br /><br />But if you're concerned about nutritional intake, here is a review of Beneful's ingredients (in order):<br /><br />Ground yellow corn<br />Chicken by-product meal<br />Corn gluten meal<br />Whole wheat flour<br />Animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E)<br />Rice flour<br />Beef<br />Soy flour<br />Sugar<br />Propylene glycol<br />Meat and bone meal<br />Etc etc etc with several dozen \"ides\" and \"ates\"<br /><br />Essentially, it's not that much different from the other dog foods sold in grocery stores.  That said, I do like the fact that the bag is a sturdy plastic and the top has a sliding \"seal\" that keeps the food secure and fresh.<br /><br />So here's how I use this food:<br />For years my dogs have been eating kibble-style food from a local pet store. Even though it's very healthy for them (chicken and lamb are the primary ingredients), I could tell they were a bit bored with it after five years.  But now, with Beneful around, my dogs \"wait\" for me to toss in a few Beneful kibbles before they start eating.  It's obvious they love the flavor, so in a way it's probably like giving them dessert (a doggie version of Twinkies?) with their dinner.<br /><br />Overall, it doesn't provide the best nutritional value, but the dogs love it. So, like I said, it might be something to consider if you have a finicky dog.  Or, you might consider it as a supplemental food if you want to provide your pups with more flavor in their meals. Personally, I wouldn't make it their main food source, but as a supplemental (and flavorful) extra I think it works just fine.",

    "review_text": "I have a 7 yr old Pom who has been on Rachel Ray's Weight Control food and green beans for 4 months and he lost his 2 extra pounds and is very healthy. The bag weighs more than he does. He knew it was his right off. I gave him a little handful while I read about the ingredients and how much to feed him. I was a bit shocked when I read the label of ingredients..the highest amount is always listed first. I expected beef or carrots no it is ground yellow corn meal, chicken by product meal, corn glutton, whole wheat flour animal fat, rice flour, beef, soy flour, sugar, propylene glycol meat and bone meal.Then tons of chemical additives, some dried corn and carrots. This is a semi soft food dogs love, no wonder just like people what tastes so good is usually bad for us. When I adopted the dog he was on another semi-soft that really is not to healthy so I switched him to Iam's Proactive. He did well on that but started to gain some weight.<br /><br />I'm sorry I didn't check the ingredients before orderings. The picture looks so healthy great balanced nutrition. Think we will stay with Rachel Ray's healthy weight food, it doesn't have all these additives. Just meat and veggies. Beneful is a misleading name.<br /><br />It can be given in small amounts I think as a treat.",

    "review_title": "A good normal dog food",
    "review_text": "For the money, this is an OK dog food in many respects.<br /><br />First, the package is smart.  I love a resealable bag.  I tend to use a large storage bin: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00186RTWW\">Iris MP-12-NAVY Airtight Pet Food Container, Navy Blue, 69 Quarts</a> but in this case, I just used the bag.<br /><br />Second, for taste, most dogs love it.  I have three, and they all enjoy this much more than they do the normal dog food that I provide them.  I think this is because this dog food is a bit like the food we eat... it's corn based and carby (it also has animal based protein and a balance of other things).  I think it's like a dinner at Chili's.  I enjoy food like that, but that doesn't mean it's the healthiest.<br /><br />Third, health: a lot of dog food reviews online are extreme.  These are dogs.  They evolved eating what man would leave them.  They do not necessarily need the extremely expensive dog foods I find at boutiques.  A dog food based on corn can be part of a nutritious diet.  This dog food does seem to have a more nutritious content than competitors at its price point.  However, it also has no chance of competing with dog foods that cost five times as much.  There is an obvious solution to this: when you eat your dinner, if you have some left over, particularly veggies and good proteins, put that on the kibble instead of throwing it out.  I've done this for years and my dogs are quite healthy.  Feeding three dogs a normal but relatively healthy dog food like this, and also supplementing that with fresh food, is an effective and affordable solution.<br /><br />Fourth, value: For what it is, I think this is priced competitively.  If you're looking for something completely different and wouldn't consider a mass produced corn based dog food, then of course this isn't for you, and that's fine.",

    "review_title": "This isn't good dog food. Here are rules for finding one:",
    "review_text": "If you know anything about canine nutrition, or care enough about your pet to want to feed them something that's good for them, you won't pick this food. Yes, it's better than Wallyworld's Old Roy (which fails my two tests below much worse than this does), but it's far from great. Here's why:<br /><br />Like all other crappy dog foods (95% of what's on the shelf at the store), corn is a major ingredient of this dog food (#1 on the ingredients list! Couldn't be worse). Dogs do not digest corn well. It makes for terrible dog food. And the meat that's included is of the \"by-product\" variety. So, it's ground chicken bones and toenails, not muscle tissue (\"meat\"). So why are these things in there? They're cheap. Filler. That's it.<br /><br />Here are my own personal rules for selecting a good dog food:<br /><br />1. If the word \"corn\" appears ANYWHERE in the ingredients, I pass. It's not good for the dog. Other grains are more okay: rice (preferably brown, not brewers), etc. A few non-corn grains are fine, but you don't want your pet eating mostly grains. While omnivorous (most fruits and veggies are great), dogs are Carnivores.<br /><br />2. Meat must be high on the ingredients list, preferably in the #1 position (\"meal\" is okay; just means dried meat. \"By-products\" are not okay).<br /><br />Those two rules pretty much guarantee you'll weed out the junk. And yes, Science Diet is junk, despite what your vet told you.<br /><br />3. My $ rule: $1 a pound or less, because I'm frugal. This is about the price point where great dog foods are obtainable (that doesn't mean all expensive dog foods are good; in fact, all of the big brands (purina, iams, eukanuba, science diet, etc) are all well-marketed, overpriced junk). The only major exception to the \"good food usually costs more\" rule that I've noticed is Costco's dog food, which is actually pretty good, and only about 25 bucks for a 40 pound bag. Best deal in canine nutrition, I think.<br /><br />Where'd I get my info? A lot of research. Start with a google search for the Whole Dog Journal's annual review of dog foods. It's the most authoritative thing out there.  Additionally, my wife is a dog trainer (the Best Friends type, not the Cesar Milan type; corn is to dog food what the \"dog whisperer\" is to dog training: junk) and works at our local humane society, where they get to test a LOT of donated foods.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and I teach the Mammalogy course at our local university. I understand mammalian anatomy and digestion.<br /><br />If you care about your pet, do your homework, people. And please don't use the \"but my dog likes this brand\" test. I love ice cream, and would eat it at every meal if I could, but my wife tells me it's not good for me. Cheap dog foods are loaded with grease to make dogs want it. Doesn't make it healthy.",

The rationale is that the corn and gluten can lead to behavior problems with the dogs, and that the animal by-products aren't the real meat that you want to feed your dog.<br /><br />I gave some to my dog to see how she liked it. I didn't want to upset her stomach, so I mixed it 50/50 with her regular IAMS kibble. I figured she would do like my kids do, gravitate towards the junk food, but she actually avoided the Beneful. She ate her IAMS first and then ate some (but not all) of the Beneful.",

For example, there are clearly pictures of steak on the package, but when I examine the ingredients list, I don't see steak listed.  I also was surprised to see sugar and food colorings in the ingredients list.  Dogs have no nutritional need for sugar, and if they needed sugar to make this yummy for the dog, it must be really low on delicious meat.  Also, I don't see the need for food colorings.  My dog doesn't care what color it is, and if I'm willing to feed him \"by-product meal,\" I'm not sure how it's improved by adding a chemical dye to make it green or whatever.  Also, the chewy bits are not good for their teeth.<br /><br />That said, my dog did act like it was Christmas when I gave him some.  So, two stars.  I won't be switching from my healthier brand to this one, though.",

I was skeptical of this because Beneful is not known for quality dog food but figured the dog probably wouldn't care and she may even like it. Unfortunately not the case. My dog routinely leaves her bowl full and won't touch the food until she gets desperate towards the end of the night. We feed her twice a day but with this food, she will barely eat a bowl a day. She just doesn't like it.<br /><br />While the packaging is very nice with a sturdy plastic, re-zipable bag, the contents are underwhelming. The dog food is shaped in nice big chunks but the ingredients (as other reviewers have noted) are chicken by-product and corn filler. I prefer to give my dog a protein and she responds well to higher quality lamb mixes.<br /><br />I don't think we'll even finish this bag and instead go back to Trader Joe's lamb meal.",

    "review_text": "The nutrition quality on this food isn't good enough that I would be happy actually feeding it to my dog as her primary food source. She does seem to like it, though, so I've been giving it to her a little at a time as a snack when I need her to eat just a little bit of something. Since it's different from what she usually gets, she seems to think of it more as a treat and she'll munch on it when she might ignore her regular food.<br /><br />The way it's packaged is nice, particularly due to the resealable zipper.<br /><br />In short, if I were actually treating this as a primary part of a dog's diet, it would be two stars at most. As an addition to my dog's diet in small quantities, she's willing to eat it in spite of being very very picky, so I'll bump it up to three.<br /><br />If you're actually looking for a primary food for your dog, on the other hand, I would definitely suggest looking for something that doesn't have corn as its first ingredient, doubly so if there's any sign your dog might have an allergy (skin irritations, frequent ear infections, that kind of thing).",

When offered this to try and review I had hoped it would be a chance to try a nutritious, wholesome food without wasting money on something he wouldn't eat.  Unfortunately that is not the case.  This food contains a lot of corn and corn is just not that good for dogs.<br />As far as taste, our adopted dog loves it.  When placed side by side with his current food he immediately went to and wolfed this down.  But dogs are like children in that when offered candy, ice cream, cookies or healthy nutritious food you know which one the child will almost always pick.  That is why it's up to the owners/dog lovers to look closely at ingredients and fillers and pick the food that is good for our animals to eat.<br />In looking at the package you would think that all the pictures of vegetables and meats would represent what is actually being served.  In this case looks are deceiving.  Is it better than some? Yes.  Are there better foods available? YES!",

    "review_text": "The most important thing to me when choosing a dog food is: Will my dog eat it or will he ignore it and work hard to people food. The last brand of dog food resulted in the latter. Purinal beneful: The former. He seems to really like it. The bowl gets emptied quickly.<br /><br />I have a Chihuahua so it is important that the kibbles be manageable size. He has absolutely no problem with these kibbles and isn't picky about which one he gets although he does seem to eat the green ones first.<br /><br />And finally, storage is always a problem. Our dog (5 pounds) will take forever to go through a bag like this. So the built-in ziplock on the bag top makes it so that we no longer have to transfer our dog food out of the container and into a plastic sealable tub.<br /><br />After reading the other reviewers concerns about the ingredients and comparing the ingredients to some higher end brands, this does seem to be inferior (a lot heavier on fillers) to the more expensive brands but in line with the others of this price range. We generally pick the best bargain among dog foods. If you are looking for the best nutrition regardless of price, you may want to look elsewhere.",

If you're truly looking to buy the BEST dog food, then you're not shopping at the grocery store in the first place. For the average dog the Beneful offers the basic nutritional requirements of course and it goes a little farther than the generics out there. The three dogs in our house that tried it (mixed with their normal far more expensive organic food) ate with no hesitation. They seemed to like the flavor and only one of them had any digestive upset and that was very mild.<br /><br /> I could not give the Beneful to the other three dogs though and this is the reason for the one star deduction....it contains corn. If you have a dog with skin allergies then you know you have to avoid corn, wheat and soy in their food and treats. Bottom line... if you're feeding a regular dog and your dogs has NO allergy issues, then Beneful is a decent choice. Just beware.. contains corn and that could be a big problem.",

I tried to head her off by offering her the old food again, but she nosed that bowl away and tried to get to the Beneful.  She ate it quickly and with great enthusiasm.  Since then, she has happily eaten it even without added water or canned food (breakfast) that she usually gets.<br /><br />I have talked to a veterinarian who said that Beneful is a perfectly acceptable food for dogs.  Given that, I still am not impressed that the first ingredient is ground yellow corn and the second is chicken by-product meal.  For dog foods that don't have meat as a primary ingredient, I would rather see a higher protein vegetable source.  It also has something called \"animal digest.\"  How appetizing does that sound?  I do like that it contains dried peas and dried carrots but those ingredients are pretty far down on the list.<br /><br />So, thumbs up for the apparent taste and appeal to my dog.  But a thumbs down for ingredients, although the list is better than some foods.  (That same vet told me that feeding a dog a specific brand of the popular economy foods would be no better than feeding her the bag it came in.)<br /><br />Overall, this isn't the worst food in the world but could be better.",

    "review_text": "I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like \"Beneful\" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food at first, and slowly began to not like it. After reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: \"When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs.\" Basically, dogs cannot fully digest corn as they are carnivores. Corn it is just a cheap filler that can cause dogs to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality pet foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value.The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging if the product does not contain the pictured items; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for,  I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store.",

Eaten in moderation, it is fine, but as a primary source of carbon molecules and proteins, it is not the easiest food source for our or our dogs' bodies to process.<br /><br />In addition to the corn products, the second ingredient is a meat by-product - not exactly the best protein source we envision when hear words like beef or chicken or meat... or see a picture of sliced muscle meat on the packaging.",

    "review_text": "My dog likes this -probably more than his regular food.  However, this is not the best choice for a healthy diet for him, in my opinion.  I was actually surprised at the ingredients. You have to go down the ingredients list to item number seven to hit beef, which is the first real meat on the list, and five of the first eight are grains/fillers.  The peas and carrots they show on the bag fall in well behind sugar, sorbitol, salt and potassium chloride, but at least ahead of the four artificial colors added.  Sorbitol is both a sweetener and a laxative and not something I'd have my dog on for any length of time.<br /><br />I think if your dog is a really picky eater, but likes this food due to its flavor and different shapes, then it would be ok and better than not eating enough.  However, this is a pretty low quality food compared to what else is on the market.  Grains and animal by-product should not be the first four ingredients in your dog's diet, unless it is the only food your dog will eat day after day.  I will be switching my dog back to Authority Lamb and Rice and leave him on it until he tires of it or they change the recipe.  It is only slightly more expensive than this food, but he needs less of it (less filler) on a daily basis, so it probably works out close to the same cost.  It also isn't the best food on the market, but it is much better than this one with more meat and less fillers and additives, and it agrees with him.",

    "review_text": "IF you are looking for a break from your dogs everyday \"ho hum\" food this is one I think most dogs will take to quickly, both of mine (Yorkie & Labradoodle) did & our cat!<br /><br />However it is not a nutrient dense, high quality protein dog food, so if that is your criteria you will want to pass on this one!<br /><br /> The bag is nice (I just love the ziplock top, plan on recycling it by using it for my dog food that doesn't have this snazzy feature.)  And last but not least I LOVE Amazon's quick shipping & not having to lug a huge bag in & out of the car up stairs etc!!<br /><br />If Amazon prices are similar to local store prices I ALWAYS opt for Amazon, it not only saves gas but my time and energy, which I am always in short supply of these days!",

    "review_title": "Resealable top and moist kibble, but too much corn",
    "review_text": "I'm pleased on behalf of my dog with this Beneful dog kibble product.<br /><br />The bag arrived in a large cardboard box so that the bag would stay intact in transit. The cardboard and packing materials are recyclable.<br /><br />The 15.5 pound bag is made of small woven plastic strips, which makes the bag reusable (as a second trash bag when emptied of dog food) and recyclable where all plastics are accepted.<br /><br />I was surprised and happy to see the new enclosure for Beneful - it has a very solid plastic 'zip' top. I'm actually thrilled about this, and wonder why all dry cat and dog food don't come with a reclosable, sealable top. I've noticed over the years that my pets prefer their kibble when fresh, so this will help the taste and texture stay palatable for far longer than the usual fold down method.<br /><br />The second very nice thing I noticed was that the kibble was moist. I think of pet kibble as hard, crunchy food, and moist kibble as gourmet specialty items that come in tiny, expensive packets. Here, there is a whole lot of nice, fresh meaty-type kibble at an economy price. The food is soft and smells good.<br /><br />Where Beneful loses a point is in the ingredients. The first item listed is ground yellow corn meal. The next ingredient is chicken by-product meal, and then there is more corn (corn gluten meal). Sugar is also highly placed in the ingredients list, but thankfully, that follows after healthy items like beef, wheat meal, animal fats, and rice and soy flours.<br /><br />A lot of dogs' digestive systems don't process corn very easily; the best dog foods place meat or wheat first in the menu, and eliminate the 'filler' corn meal entirely. Since Beneful is positioning themselves as a 'healthy choice' kibble, it's important to be aware of pet issues with corn.<br /><br />I don't see why dog food needs bright dyes either. The only possible reason is to make it 'prettier' for people to look at. I would ask Purina to reconsider that aspect, as well as removing the corn.<br /><br />In spite of the corn meal and unnecessary food dyes, my dog LOVED this new chewy kibble. She actually made happy little grunty noises while eating it, noises I'd never heard from her before.<br /><br />Dog approved, and person-approved, with the understanding that this is a mid-line pet food. :)",

    "review_text": "This is one of the dog foods that people think is healthy for dogs due to its marketing and packaging! Oh it has vegetables on the packaging, it must be nutritious! Sadly its rated at the bottom of most dog food rating sites as far as nutritional value ( but for a one star food a high one star food )..<br /><br />With that said my dogs loved it- I mixed a handful in with my normal Kirkland brand food and it helped enhance their appetites and they wanted more. It's priced fairly high compared to other dog foods of the same nutritional value..<br /><br />In conclusion I try to feed my dogs the best possible food nutrition wise ( without breaking the bank ).. If you want a lot of dog waste to pick up feed lower grade foods with corn meal as first ingredient ( google the importance of first ingrediants ) Beneful might be a good filler food if fed with other higher quality foods if trying to maximize your feeding",

    "review_text": "OK, the dog scarfs this down. But put a bowl of M&M's and a bowl of Broccoli in front of a child, and guess which bowl will be empty? It's the same with this.  I mix this with healthier food as filler. My dog is not that active, and all these carbs and fat would make for one fat puppy.  If, on the other hand, he was active and outside all the time, running around, etc. the carbs would burn off (same as for people!)  Fat is supposedly good for the dog's coat and skin.  So, if your dog is a finicky eater, fido will inhale this.  If you have an active dog, this is probably fine. If it's an indoor pet, this is better off as a mix-in, but not as a staple.<br /><br />There's no smell, and the food does not clump or stick. The bag is really sturdy - it's made of the same stuff as those blue tarps, so won't tear, and any opening you make won't spread.",

    "review_text": "These Popchips are delicious! The best thing I like about them is that they're crunchy and airy with a perfect blend of chili and lime flavoring. I love the boldness of the chili and tartness of the lime! Each chip appears to me like two thin potato chips sealed together with air inside! That might be a bit fanciful, but that's how it feels when I bite into one. They satisfy my taste buds and I get an extra jolt from the airiness and crunchiness.<br /><br />What else can I say, except: Yum! Yum! And, oh, yes, with all-natural ingredients and only 100 calories for the entire bag, my Dr. approves them too.<br /><br />Reviewed by Betty Dravis, February 22, 2012<br />Author of \"Dream Reachers\" series of books (with Chase Von)",

The popchips give a nice satisfying crunch, and I would not have know they weren't fried. They have the nice mouth-feel of a fried chip, they don't taste baked or rice cracker-ish. The only off putting problem I had was these are really sweet. I don't mean sweet potato sweet, I mean eating a salty sugar cube sweet. I checked and the carb count isn't bad, there are only 2 grams of sugar, but these have a weird sweet taste and a strange after taste. If you like the sweet salty trend, the salted caramel or bacon sweets, you'll probably really like these, I prefer a more savory crunchy snack.",

They have a sort of puffy physical trait and kind of remind me of the Munchos chips I used to eat as a kid.  You still get the crunchy feeling of a chip, but they are just \"different\" than a regular potato chip.<br /><br />As a huge fan of barbecue Popchips, I was very anxious to try the Chili Lime flavor.  After the first few chips I ate, I didn't think there was much kick to it.  However, it seems like the more you eat, the spicier they get.  I didn't neccesarily taste the lime in it.  I would personally prefer a little sweetness to the chili flavor, which it didn't have, so maybe that's where the lime falls in.  Overall, these chips have a lot of flavor and are decently spicy.  They are now my 2nd favorite Popchips flavor behind the barbecue.  So, if you like a little spice in your chips, definitely try the chili lime variety.",

    "review_text": "NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're \"probably\" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a \"tomato\" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like \"Tomato and Basil\" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now.",

    "review_text": "I really enjoy sweet potato chips, sweet potato fries, baked sweet potatoes, etc., so I was eager to try these Popchips.  They did not disappoint!  The flavor of the sweet potato is just right, mixed with a bit of saltiness - very tasty!  Just the right amount of light crunch, more like popcorn.<br /><br />At 100 calories per bag, these fit right into my eating plan that allows two 100-150 calorie snacks per day.  That made me extra happy!  There are plenty in the bag, too, unlike the small servings usually found in low-calorie snack packs.<br /><br />I shared these with a friend who came over one afternoon, since she also professed a love of sweet potatoes.  She asked for some extra to take home, she really enjoyed them.<br /><br />All the good Vitamin A content that you would normally find in a sweet potato has completely vanished in the processing of these, however.  I don't expect much from chips, I guess, still a bit disappointing.<br /><br />The bags are very thick, for a chip bag.  My 9 & 12 yr. old kids had trouble opening these, and resorted to scissors.  I should also mention that they are not fans of sweet potatoes, and did not care for these either.  That's ok - more for me!",

There's only 100 calories per bag and you actually get enough to feel satisfied.  We've tried the sweet potato and jalapeno flavors with less desirable results.  They taste too manufactured to us - the flavor is too intense.  We much prefer the basic original chip that remind us so much of Munchos.  They are nicely salty and have a great crunch.  They would make great crunchy toppings in recipes as opposed to breadcrumbs though I haven't tried anything beyond slipping a few onto my turkey sandwiches.  (Right, like you've never done it.)",

    "review_text": "I wanted to have \"sized\" portions of chip-type product that would be tasty and filling.  I tried at least 6 different brands of popcorn-type snack packages (unfortunately, most came in 24-36 item packages).  After receiving the first 5 brands, I felt they were total waste of money.... 2 had texture of light styrofoam peanuts, with almost no flavor.  A couple others had reasonably nice flavor, BUT only had a couple small handfuls of popcorn in each bag so way overpriced and I definitely did not feel satisfied after 1 bag.<br /><br />Then I received the variety pack of PopChips.  I first tried the barbeque, which turned out to be my favorite.  They have nice strong bbq flavor, nice texture, and each bag has enough to feel satisfying.  The Original and Sour Cream and Onion came in lower second, but most of the others were just ok to fair- (not worth eating for my tastes but interesting).<br /><br />Best of all, the nutrition counts are good, with each bag only having 100 cals, 3 grams fat and 15g carbs (0 Cholesterol).<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product (and above flavors) over all the other popcorn types I tried.<br /><br />P.S.  PopCorners White Cheddar brand came in SECOND.  Nice crunchy texture and pleasant cheddar flavor",

But they are truly addicting - I could only find them sporadically in my local grocery (HEB and Randalls both sold them, at least for a time), but once I found them here on Amazon, I started ordering them by the case and get to save money to boot.  These chips are not like regular chips - the texture is different, I assume from the \"popping,\" but once you taste them, you will become addicted, too! One of my all-time favorite snack foods!!",

Nonetheless I have eaten my share of potato chips over the years, and perhaps as a result I have been watching my weight lately.  I discovered these great popchips and they hit the spot in a number of ways.  First they are a low-calorie alternative to regular potato chips, meaning I can eat a normal-sized portion and still keep on target with my weight loss goals.  Second, they are gluten-free, which is great for those of us who have gluten intolerance issues.  Third, they taste great - light and airy, crispy, rich in that great potato flavor that keeps me reaching for another one.  This is a great product and I hope it stays around for a good long time.",

They are the right mix of sweet and salty so all those cravings get satisfied in one bite.  They are light and crispy.  If you have ever had a Muncho chip, they are similar in texture to those but not so salty like a Muncho.  You really don't get a strong sweet potato flavor and I at two small bags in one setting with ease.  They are low fat, low calorie (100 calories per bag which is a serving).  They contain natural ingredients like sunflower and safflower oil, sea salt, and organic yellow corn flour.  They are very very good.",

I guess I was hoping for a cheesy jalapeno.<br />Original - Not super flavorful but great for dipping<br />Cheddar - Yummy<br />Parmesan Garlic - So Garlicky.

    "review_text": "As I write this review, I'm looking at 3 large boxes of Popchips stacked in my living room.  I bought 2 of the 3 boxes, which each contain 24 bags of the chips.  One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.  The flavor isn't quite right, in my view.  My favorite flavor is barbecue followed by plain and the variety pack is a good way to figure out what you like the best.  But I cannot recommend Chili Lime Popchips.",

    "review_text": "I've never been a big fan on chips. When it comes to snack foods, I'm more of a pretzel guy, or maybe something cheesy. Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these \"chips\" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's \"good\" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again.",

It's the only low-fat chip that gave me the same \"crunch\" as my favourite (super unhealthy) alternative - Kettle chips. I just ordered these last week, and my oh my, I think this is my favourite flavour now! Since I'm vegetarian, the BBQ flavour doesnt appeal to me, but I'm dying to try the Garlic Parm & Sour Cream and Onion... and OH, the cheddar ones are on their way.. can't wait :D... POPCHIPS ROCK and are a part of my daily 3pm snack routine :D",

    "review_text": "These Popchips are delicious! The best thing I like about them is that they're crunchy and airy with a perfect blend of chili and lime flavoring.

That might be a bit fanciful, but that's how it feels when I bite into one.

The only off putting problem I had was these are really sweet. I don't mean sweet potato sweet, I mean eating a salty sugar cube sweet. I checked and the carb count isn't bad, there are only 2 grams of sugar, but these have a weird sweet taste and a strange after taste. If you like the sweet salty trend, the salted caramel or bacon sweets, you'll probably really like these, I prefer a more savory crunchy snack.",

They have a sort of puffy physical trait and kind of remind me of the Munchos chips I used to eat as a kid.  You still get the crunchy feeling of a chip, but they are just \"different\" than a regular potato chip.<br /><br />As a huge fan of barbecue Popchips, I was very anxious to try the Chili Lime flavor.  After the first few chips I ate, I didn't think there was much kick to it.  However, it seems like the more you eat, the spicier they get.  I didn't neccesarily taste the lime in it.  I would personally prefer a little sweetness to the chili flavor, which it didn't have, so maybe that's where the lime falls in.  Overall, these chips have a lot of flavor and are decently spicy.  They are now my 2nd favorite Popchips flavor behind the barbecue.  So, if you like a little spice in your chips, definitely try the chili lime variety.",

    "review_text": "NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're \"probably\" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a \"tomato\" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like \"Tomato and Basil\" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now.",

My sugar is high but I feel comfortable eating these in moderation since the carbs are lower than chips.<br /><br />  I originally bought the variety pack so I could try them all, and I liked them all although somewhat partial to the Cheddar.

    "review_text": "We got the sweet potato flavor through the Vine program.  I was genuinely surprised by how good these were.  Crunchy but light texture.  Just the right balance of sweet and salty.  Portion controlled bags have only a 100 calories and 95 mg of sodium.  These are definitely a healthier alternative to potato chips.  But don't mistake \"healthier\" for \"healthy.\"  They have almost no nutritional value (1 g protein, 2% iron).  So don't let all the buzzwords on the packaging fool you.  Still, if you are looking for a light snack that won't ruin your diet, this is a good choice.  As an FYI, despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe, sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.  Rice flour is the first ingredient, followed by sweet potato flakes, tapioca starch, a blend of various oils, corn flour, seasonings, etc. Not a huge deal, but its one of those \"truth in advertising\" points that annoys me so I mention it.",

    "review_text": "I really enjoy sweet potato chips, sweet potato fries, baked sweet potatoes, etc., so I was eager to try these Popchips.  They did not disappoint!  The flavor of the sweet potato is just right, mixed with a bit of saltiness - very tasty!  Just the right amount of light crunch, more like popcorn.<br /><br />At 100 calories per bag, these fit right into my eating plan that allows two 100-150 calorie snacks per day.  That made me extra happy!  There are plenty in the bag, too, unlike the small servings usually found in low-calorie snack packs.<br /><br />I shared these with a friend who came over one afternoon, since she also professed a love of sweet potatoes.  She asked for some extra to take home, she really enjoyed them.<br /><br />All the good Vitamin A content that you would normally find in a sweet potato has completely vanished in the processing of these, however.  I don't expect much from chips, I guess, still a bit disappointing.<br /><br />The bags are very thick, for a chip bag.  My 9 & 12 yr. old kids had trouble opening these, and resorted to scissors.  I should also mention that they are not fans of sweet potatoes, and did not care for these either.  That's ok - more for me!",

There's only 100 calories per bag and you actually get enough to feel satisfied.  We've tried the sweet potato and jalapeno flavors with less desirable results.  They taste too manufactured to us - the flavor is too intense.  We much prefer the basic original chip that remind us so much of Munchos.  They are nicely salty and have a great crunch.  They would make great crunchy toppings in recipes as opposed to breadcrumbs though I haven't tried anything beyond slipping a few onto my turkey sandwiches.  (Right, like you've never done it.)",

    "review_text": "I wanted to have \"sized\" portions of chip-type product that would be tasty and filling.  I tried at least 6 different brands of popcorn-type snack packages (unfortunately, most came in 24-36 item packages).  After receiving the first 5 brands, I felt they were total waste of money.... 2 had texture of light styrofoam peanuts, with almost no flavor.  A couple others had reasonably nice flavor, BUT only had a couple small handfuls of popcorn in each bag so way overpriced and I definitely did not feel satisfied after 1 bag.<br /><br />Then I received the variety pack of PopChips.  I first tried the barbeque, which turned out to be my favorite.  They have nice strong bbq flavor, nice texture, and each bag has enough to feel satisfying.  The Original and Sour Cream and Onion came in lower second, but most of the others were just ok to fair- (not worth eating for my tastes but interesting).<br /><br />Best of all, the nutrition counts are good, with each bag only having 100 cals, 3 grams fat and 15g carbs (0 Cholesterol).<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product (and above flavors) over all the other popcorn types I tried.<br /><br />P.S.  PopCorners White Cheddar brand came in SECOND.  Nice crunchy texture and pleasant cheddar flavor",

I discovered these great popchips and they hit the spot in a number of ways.  First they are a low-calorie alternative to regular potato chips, meaning I can eat a normal-sized portion and still keep on target with my weight loss goals.  Second, they are gluten-free, which is great for those of us who have gluten intolerance issues.

They are not as healthy as eating fruits and veggies, and are still chips, but they are a much MORE healthy alternative to your regular chip.  And they do still have an excellent taste!  Sour cream and onion is amazing, but so are the other flavors!  (Whatever your person preference is!)",

They are the right mix of sweet and salty so all those cravings get satisfied in one bite.  They are light and crispy.

You really don't get a strong sweet potato flavor and I at two small bags in one setting with ease.  They are low fat, low calorie (100 calories per bag which is a serving).  They contain natural ingredients like sunflower and safflower oil, sea salt, and organic yellow corn flour.  They are very very good.",

    "review_text": "As I write this review, I'm looking at 3 large boxes of Popchips stacked in my living room.  I bought 2 of the 3 boxes, which each contain 24 bags of the chips.  One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.  The flavor isn't quite right, in my view.  My favorite flavor is barbecue followed by plain and the variety pack is a good way to figure out what you like the best.  But I cannot recommend Chili Lime Popchips.",

    "review_text": "I've never been a big fan on chips. When it comes to snack foods, I'm more of a pretzel guy, or maybe something cheesy. Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these \"chips\" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's \"good\" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again.",

My dog is 60lbs not small but it was affecting her stomach. I stopped for a week and her stool was back to normal. The other day I gave her one greenie to see how she would react and 12hrs later the diarrhea is back.

In particular, ones about dogs vomitting green sponges after eating them.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I have a little maltese (Dexter). He's a little over two years old and loves greenies. Absolutely loves them. They're his favorite treat. He loves to hide them and then go back for them later.<br /><br />A couple things to watch for... the package says to only feed them one a day. We were feeding him like 3 or 4 a day. We thought it was like a dental treat and couldn't hurt. We've cut it back to one a day and every once and awhile we'll give him two.<br /><br />Another thing, they can be messy. When we first got him and he was tiny, it would take him awhile to eat them. Once they get wet, they tend to stick to things. Now that he's older, he eats them pretty fast so there's no problem.<br /><br />We've never had him vomit from them, ever. Even when we were giving him 4 a day. He loves them and has never gotten ill from them. One time, he got into the package when we weren't paying attention and hid them all over the house so he probably has a secret stash somewhere.<br /><br />I would stick to the product recommendations (if you can) and if your dog is like ours, he'll love them.",

I highly recommend these for anyone who likes bold coffee, people who prefer something like a breakfast blend would probably find Jet Fuel to be too bitter.

We looked over the list of coffees that would be available and selected Coffee People Jet Fuel K-Cups because the label and description included \"Dark Extra Bold.\"  We are very satisfied with the new coffee.  It has the strong, rich flavor and aroma we like.  It is difficult to distinguish this Jet Fuel coffee from our old favorite Parisian Nights.  All of the subscription coffees are in boxes of 50 K-Cups which is a little more economical than the former 24 K-Cup boxes.  This savings plus the discount for subscribing to automatic free shipping results in the lowest cost we have found for these K-Cups.",

Espresso is fine with me, and when I make my own coffee I make it as strong as can be.  If all I have is instant I  at least quadruple the amount of coffee to water.  In other words, I like a strong coffee, and Jet Fuel by my standards is strong in flavor only.  Okay strong isn't the best word; HARSH would be a better word.  It's not a pleasurable drinking experience.<br /><br />I took some to work to let a coworker try it, and I think he nailed the aroma and flavor of this Jet Fuel coffee.  He said it's like a dirty ashtray.  After he said that it clicked in my mind.  Dang, yes that is what it tastes like.  Now, I will give the benefit of the doubt that I got a bad batch, but so far since I was a sucker and bought 50 of them, I keep drinking them usually adding instant coffee, or another nicer flavored coffee to it to kill the ashtray flavor because all of them taste the same so far.<br /><br />Be warned, I'm no stranger to harsh coffee, but this IMHO is not a pleasant harsh.<br /><br />J",

Maxwell House crowd perhaps.  I prefer coffee with more depth and complexity, i.e. Starbucks, and Jet Fuel misses that mark by a wide margin.<br /><br />My favorite K Cups so far have been Donut Shop, Kona, and Caribou Blend.  Caribou is a great choice if you like bold and rich coffee, but now I am stuck with 50 cups of Jet Fuel.  Don't believe the hype.",

At $27 a 50-ct. case, I can walk into any number of retailers with a basic sale or easily accessible coupon and get a MUCH better deal.  Sorry Amazon!

    "review_text": "When I drink coffee I like it with half and half or light cream. I like the consistency and flavor of a high fat cream product mixed with the coffee or espresso based drink (no matter whether it is a hot or cold or frozen espresso based drink). The illy issimo cappucino is made with lowfat milk and indeed it tastes thin and watery.<br /><br />The flavor of this espresso is pretty mild, I think. My favorite coffee is a dark robust french roast. Although this illy issimo drink is made with espresso as a base I'd call it mild but others would say it's medium. I'm a Starbucks lover and I love the cafe au lait New Orleans style coffee with chickory also.<br /><br />I rate this drink 3 stars = It's Okay because for me, it's too thin due to the lowfat milk and it's flavor is not quite bold enough for my palate. If you like lowfat milk in your coffee and if you like mild or medium boldness you will probably like this better than I did.",

    "review_title": "Not bad overall - would pick if I can't find my all time favorites",
    "review_text": "I went ahead and tried this - the idea of a coffee drink in a can in this country under 100 calories is always inviting.  (I love Japan and China where there are so many different ones some served hot some cold, all from vending machines and convenience stores, but the US is sadly much more limited).<br /><br />Rockstar Vanilla Roasted remains my number one choice for canned or bottled coffee.  That said, I enjoyed this and would choose it over pretty much anything made by Starbucks and DEFINITELY over anything made by Archer Farms (or whatever that Target brand is) or Monster (ew, ew, ew) that's in my local grocery or gas station.<br /><br />I like it because 1) it actually tastes like coffee instead of some weird flavored creme thing and 2) it isn't horribly sweet - maybe a tad more than I prefer but I like my sweetness really low in cold coffee so that's a personal preference.  The aftertaste is good...pleasant not strong and not going sour an hour later.  The coffee kick is also there so it's a good pick me up.<br /><br />However, it's still not perfect.  A few complaints: 1) It's got a bitter metallic taste that hits every time you first get some in your mouth.  It's not a normal coffee or espresso flavor - it fades quick and isn't horrible, but it's weird and not my favorite, 2) the can is a little flimsy.  The edges rolled over on the top of mine even though it shipped in a padded envelop.  I don't know that it would puncture any easier though - most cans are thin at around the cylinder.  3) biggest complaint - the mouth is too small.  You couldn't glug it if you want to, but it's also kind of awkward.  Basically forces sipping and makes it so it's hard not to completely cover it with your mouth if you're used to other cans which creates a bad situation for flow (for a liquid to flow into your mouth easily, air has to flow into the can easily to replace it.)<br /><br />Anyway, 4 stars.  If I don't have access to my own french pressed coffee from home, don't feel like paying for specialty coffee, and can't find the Rockstars on shelf, I could see reaching for this as the next choice when I really want some coffee flavored caffeine.",

    "review_text": "Based on some of the reviews here, I'm wondering what some of the other reviewers here were expecting.  If you expect ANY canned/bottled coffee drink to taste like a fresh iced coffee from a local coffee house (that has actual frothed cream in it and was sugared to your own personal preference), you are going to be disappointed.  I am comparing it to other coffee drinks that also use lowfat milk in them.<br /><br />I'm drinking this wonderful little beverage, as I type the review.  As is consistent with the illy issimo coffee drinks, it's refreshingly restrained on the sugar.  Just enough to compliment the coffee, without trying to turn it into a confection.  This has just enough of the lowfat mik in it to give a slight \"creamy\" taste, without overpowering the flavor of the coffee, as well.<br /><br />There is a perfect blending of the cocoa, cream and sugar to combine with (and compliment) the coffee flavor.  It's not quite as robust as the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA\">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>. But then again, if you desired that you wouldn't be drinking a cappuccino.<br /><br />I think the illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave; is probably better for a quick wake up call on a rough Monday morning, and this is better suited for around 3 o'clock to help get you to through the rest of the work day.<br /><br />Serve chilled, and whatever you do, don't shake it. It might \"asplode\". :)",

I liked it better than Starbucks coffee, which usually has a burnt taste to me. My favorite coffee always was Dunkin Donuts, but even that has changed over the years, (or maybe my taste has change).

    "review_text": "I love cappucino, at home or at my local coffee house, so I hoped that this illy issimo cappuncino coffee drink would be a good substitute.  Alas, it was not to be.<br /><br />Here's my take on this cappucino drink:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1.  Convenience -- With these cans at home or at the office, you can heat up a full cup of cappucino in a minute in the microwave. No dragging out the cappucino maker or running out to get a cappucino.<br /><br />2.  Foam -- After heating, you will see a small amount of foam on the top of the coffee.<br /><br />3.  Low-Cal -- Only 100 calories in this cappucino,<br /><br />and therein lies my problem.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1.  Taste -- Even though I love cappucino, I don't have it often.  When I do give in to the urge, I want it rich with two packs of raw sugar, whole milk, and a generous dash of cinnamon on the foam.  Heavenly.  But this cappucino just doesn't measure up to my idea of what cappucino should be.<br /><br />2.  Off Flavor -- There's an odd taste of tin in my cup.  Maybe it's the cinnamon, maybe it's the can -- I can't say, but I can say that the flavor is tinged with an odd tinny taste.<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />If you're not picky about cappucino, this could be your drink.  I'll wait and get mine just the way I like it at my local coffee house.",

Not too much nor too little.<br />- Flavor: Dominant notes are coffee, chocolate, and milk, in that order.  Pretty balanced.<br />- Size: 8.5 oz single serving is great size I think.<br />- Freshness: coffee flavor is good.  Not stale nor acidic.<br />- 100 calories is very reasonable, especially compared to many sweetened drinks you might order at an espresso bar.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- Nothing major.

    "review_text": "I decided to try this illy issimo Cappucino Coffee Drink, as I do enjoy the Starbucks and Caribou chilled coffee drinks from the grocery store as an occasional indulgence. My immediate reaction upon trying this was that it is very thin and watery. I'm assuming a big reason for that is they use lowfat milk. The Starbucks and Caribou drinks I usually buy are slightly more unhealthy than this drink, but they have a rich, flavorful taste and are slightly more substantive compared to this drink. Since I only drink them on the rare occasion (maybe a couple times a month), the health differences aren't a huge deal for me.<br /><br />This Cappucino does have a nice light flavor to it, with equal hints of cocoa and coffee, but it's not nearly as boldly flavored as the aforementioned drinks. Considering the price is just as expensive as others in the category, I don't think this would be my first choice when on the go and in need of a quick pick-me-up. However, I wouldn't be completely opposed to buying it for a change of pace down the road.<br /><br />If you enjoy a lightly flavored coffee drink that's not too thick, you'd probably love the illy issimo line of drinks. Either way, it's worth a try if you can buy it in a single can to see how you like it before choosing to buy it in bulk. Just as a side note, the product touts being \"Italian Espresso Style,\" but it's actually a product of Denmark not Italy (for anybody keeping score at home).",

    "review_text": "I love cappucinos, so I thought this would be a relatively easy item to review since I'm already pre-disposed to like anything that contains expresso. After drinking this, I can honestly say that I'm underwhelmed.<br /><br />Taste-wise, this isn't bad but it isn't great either. It's pretty much your run of the mill canned expresso beverage and while I've had worse, there wasn't that much to make it stand out. As others have said, the cocoa flavor just isn't there. That wouldn't actually be something I'd speak out against, except that the drink does claim that it's in there and there will be people who will be expecting to actually taste cocoa. It's not here, or if it is then it's so faint that you wouldn't be able to taste it unless you're really, really looking for it.<br /><br />Now the good thing about this is that it isn't overly sweet. I do like sweet coffee/expresso beverages, but a lot of times the bottled or canned beverages will be just overly saturated with it. This drink isn't, which was actually a nice change of pace and something that I know some of you will appreciate. Another thing that some might like is that it's only 100 calories for the full can, which was nice. It's still 19 carbs, but it's good to have a low calorie option for those of us that are trying to avoid the coffee drinks that have a bajillion calories.<br /><br />Overall, this just didn't stand out that much to me. It's good enough that I'd probably buy it if I was at the store, wanted a cold coffee/expresso drink, but didn't want anything sweet. I just don't know if I'd go out of my way to buy it and stock it up for those times when I really crave stuff like this.",

    "review_text": "Produced in Denmark and distributed stateside by Coca-Cola, illy issimo is a tasty little coffee drink that would likely appeal to the same folks that regularly buy Starbucks Frappuccino in glass bottles.  For the purposes of this review, I will try to compare the two products which are similar and yet also strikingly different.<br /><br />The illy drink is slightly smaller than a bottled Frapp, offering 8.45 ounces as opposed to Starbuck's 9.5 ounces.  Yet nutritionally, within that small difference, I found that illy has 90 fewer calories (100 as opposed to 190) and one gram less saturated fat (1 as opposed to 2) than Starbucks.  These are minimal differences unless, of course, you drink these sorts of beverages regularly.  Drinking illy once per day instead of a Starbucks Frapp would ultimately save you close to 33,000 calories in a full calendar year and, of course, 365 grams of saturated fat.<br /><br />As far as taste, I found that illy emphasized the coffee flavor with a refreshing hint of chocolate.  As far as the bottled Frappuccino goes, I've found that Starbucks is the exact opposite, emphasizing the chocolate taste with more of a hint of coffee.  Ultimately, it's up to personal tastes.  I'm not a regular bottled coffee drinker, but I would be willing to reach more often for illy for the simple fact that it's a little bit healthier and a little less sweet than Starbucks.",

It taste like a good cup of coffee, smooth and not bitter or acidic. However,  to me it is not creamy like Cappuccino.  I would have rated this 4 stars for the taste but because I do not consider this a Cappuccino I lowered this to three stars.  Each 8.45 ounce serving is 100 calories with 15 calories from fat.  The first four ingredients are coffee, low fat milk, sugar, and cocoa powder.<br /><br />Now my boyfriend really liked this drink (he shared it with me) and said it tasted very creamy to him.  He likes caffeine so at 81 mg it's about half the mg in a cup of drip coffee (115 - 175 mg).  He felt this tastes better than Starbucks drinks.  However, at the current price of about $1.80 per can he thought it was too expensive and would rate this 4 stars only because of the price.  If the price were $1.25 per can,  he would buy this and have rated it 5 stars.",

This illy iced coffee just left a little to be desired for me, which is where it loses its two stars.<br /><br />If you're a true coffee connoisseur, you might find that you prefer this brand over Starbucks.

I like cappuccino beverages and I am a regular consumer of coffee, so this beverage sounded like something suitable to my tastes.<br /><br />This cappuccino drink is a little different from what I expected. Poured from the can into a glass, it looks like chilled hot chocolate with a mocha scent. It also contains a little less volume than I would prefer. The can is only 8.45 fluid ounces in size, so it is consumed completely in a very short time.<br /><br />As for the taste, it isn't as rich as I was expecting. I wanted something a little stronger and fuller bodied- something closer to an espresso. The taste of this drink, while certainly not bad, isn't very strong. It is chocolaty and coffee- like, as expected, with a creamy, medium to light body. It tends toward the sweet side, which is also not my preference. I drink all coffee- related beverages black, so I am not used to tasting sugar with my roasted brew. In addition, the sugar flavor in this beverage is different in taste and part of the reason is because the manufacturer uses beet sugar. This is probably healthier than refined sugar, but it does result in a little different flavor that may not suit the preferences of different drinkers.<br /><br />I like a good cappuccino and this one is really not a bad selection. A few tweaks of the recipe would make it a little better, but I agree that it is very easy drinking and has enough good taste to recommend.",

The sugar is a little bit strong at 18 grams for the 8.45 ounce can but overall, that's low in comparison to many competing brands.  It's got a nice strong cofee taste and hint of chocolate which is strong enough to add to some ice and blend if you want to cut your sugar intake and economize by using half a can at a time.<br /><br />Unlike their Canned Espresso, this item does have some thickening agents like Carageenan (a seeweed extract used the way Chia seed glop is used to thicken) and Cellulose Gum which is a plant fiber derived thickening agent.  But most canned Cappuccinos have these and usually higher on the list. It's likely there because they opted for lowfat milk.  The thickeners are liekly to make up for the lack of Milkfat.  Since they're common food addtives and not something I don't ordinarily get in most prepraed foods, I'm not bothered by it.  In fact, itheir ingredient list is quite short compared to some manufacturers' canned of bottled Cappuccino drinks.  At least they don't add oil to it!  As for the Cafeine load - Issimo has 81 Mgs of Caffeine which is still less than 2 Excedrin tablets so that's not a huge amount of caffeine by comparison.<br /><br />I enjoyed this and will likely use it as my new canned Cappucino option.  The price is comperable to my old brand and cheaper than others. As far as the sugar issue goes, I'll likely drink half a can at a time and blend it with ise since that's the way I like my Cappucinos.  I won't be missing the line at Starbucks or all the added calories.  This way, I can choose what I add to my Cappuccino and my waistline!",

    "review_title": "Better chilled",
    "review_text": "I decided to test this drink in three ways.  Chilled, Iced, Hot.<br /><br />I first put the can in the refrigerator over night.  I then divided the can into three equal portions a little less than 3 oz. each.<br /><br />One I poured into a small glass, the second I poured over crushed ice, and the third I put into a cup and heated it to normal coffee temperature in the microwave.<br /><br />I then tasted the chilled but un-iced drink.  I found the coffee flavor came through well enough, but the additives gave it a slightly off flavor from the pure cappuccino taste.<br /><br />I then tasted the iced version - after stirring the liquid in the glass along with the crushed ice.  The flavors disappeared to a marked degree - a slight coffee taste, but mostly just a cold beverage with a coffee background.<br /><br />I then tasted the microwaved version - the coffee flavors were there, but it just tasted like a weak cup of coffee - certainly not a cappuccino.<br /><br />As an afternoon drink when real coffee is not available and you want that coffee flavor, this drink makes an acceptable beverage to gulp down chilled.<br /><br />Don't expect this to be anything like a real strong cup of real cappuccino or espresso.<br /><br />As an explanation of my own preferences - I like very strong coffee - Turkish being my absolute favorite.  Also, an iced coffee properly prepared is a thing of delight to me.  The best I ever had was at a small place in Kyoto where the very strong coffee was chilled and served over ice in a tall glass, with a separate small pitcher of cream, and another of a simple sugar syrup, allowing the consumer to \"fix it the way they wanted.\"",

    "review_text": "Because I like Starbucks Mocha coffee very much (is it coffee or cocoa?), I expected to like this ILLY ISSIMO \"Cappuccino\" drink. But what a surprise! It turned out to be a strange, thin, \"milky drink\". The low-fat milk taste dominates, and the coffee and cocoa flavors seem barely there. At least the drink does not taste sugary, as does the otherwise quite decent <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA\">ILLY ISSIMO \"Caff&egrave;\"</a> alternative. However, this larger-sized \"Cappuccino\" actually has far more sugar, at 18g.<br /><br />I do not know whether this canned coffee product is supposed to be consumed hot, chilled, or at room temperature. The can includes a \"do not shake\" warning, but has no other instructions. I tried the product after chilling for one day in the refrigerator, and after warming in a microwave-safe cup. It tasted about the same both ways. Perhaps it was a little better hot, but it came out of the microwave with an \"unmixed instant coffee\" swirl on top.<br /><br />This \"Italian espresso-style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa\" certainly did not convert me to canned coffee drinks, especially ones with 100 calories in a single 8.45 fl. oz. can. Because this ILLY ISSIMO \"Cappuccino\" tastes odd, and mostly like milk, I award it 2 stars on Amazon's scale (\"I don't like it\").",

    "review_title": "Weak espresso",
    "review_text": "illy issimo Cappuccino Coffee Drink is a fairly new coffee to go drink for those times you need a coffee, but are cannot get to the coffee shop.  It is an 8.45 ounce, 100 calorie can of coffee-like goodness.<br />Yes, it actually does contain coffee.  Pretty good coffee, actually.  Illy is not new to the coffee world and some of their beans produce delicious coffee.  Its not surprising they decided to branch out to the portable market.  In doing so, they have joined forces with Coca Cola, likely because of their ability to mass market as well as produce an inexpensive canned product.<br />A cappuccino to an Italian is generally one third espresso, one third steamed milk, and one third foam.  Obviously the steamed milk and foam would be impossible in a chilled can.  But this is meant to be the chilled version of that drink.  Yet it contains cocoa.  Indiscernible cocoa, but it is right there on the label.  I find it a bit confusing, since there are actually 5 different illy flavors.  They also offer Cafe<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA\">illy issimo Caffe Coffee Drink, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>, Mochaccino,<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UOA31I\">illy issimo Mochaccino, 8.45-Ounces Cans (Pack of 12)</a> Cafe sugar free,<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I2FGQE\">illy issimo Caffe Coffee Drink, No Sugar, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>, latte macchiato, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJJI\">illy issimo Latte Macchiato Coffee Drink, 8.45-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.  I would have expected the mochaccino to have a chocolate flavor, and cappuccino to be strong espresso with milk.<br />So, upon opening the can, I expected a (Starbucks) canned frappuccino-like drink.  Despite the warnings stamped all around the top to not shake the can, I could not stop myself.  No explosion, so not sure what that warning is all about.  The coffee drink inside is a rich brown color, tempered with low fat milk.  Has a certain appeal, although I think it might feel more decadent poured over ice.  And while illy knows its coffee, they did not use enough of it in this prepared drink.  Strong espresso can stand up to the addition of milk, and this was not strong enough.  Had a watered down taste to it, much like home brewed coffee with added milk and sugar.  One thing I dislike about frappuccinos is the texture and somewhat artificial thickness.  illy wins hands down here, because the texture has not been altered.  It definitely feels real.<br />Keeping it under 100 calories is a plus, especially if one plans to drink these regularly.  Large fatty fattening coffees with sugar and cream should be reserved for special treats and given dessert status in our lives.  But you could get away with a 100 calorie drink much more often without sacrificing your health.<br />Overall, the Cappuccino Coffee drink is a pretty average addition to the ready to drink coffee market.  While the ingredients are well thought out (no high fructose corn syrup here!), the proportions left me feeling as though I had enjoyed some average coffee, watered down with milk and a bit of sugar sprinkled over.  Happy it was not any sweeter, just wish it had a richer coffee flavor.",

    "review_text": "Competing with a company like Starbucks must be different.  To succeed, you either need to be creative enough to stand out or of such a high quality, you can gain traction.  Illycaff&egrave;, the Italian coffee company that created this product, is actually decades older than Starbucks.  However, they're relatively new (since 2009) to producing the single-serving canned beverages known as \"Illy Issimo.\"  One thing that's for sure, if you're going to compete with a giant like Starbucks, it helps to have a giant of a partner.  Illycaff&egrave; has Coca-Cola, so we can call it a fair fight.  There are five different flavours of the Illy Issimo canned coffees: Caffe, Sugar-Free Caffe, Cappuccino, Mochaccino, and Latte Macchiato.<br /><br />The first flavour I decided to try was the classic Cappuccino.  Here's a breakdown of the elements:<br /><br />Smell: Dull, unappetizing, with only hints of a Cappuccino aroma.<br /><br />Taste: Quite the same as the smell.  It's not a vibrant Cappuccino taste and, though brewed with Arabica, the coffee flavour is just not strong enough.  The aftertaste, also, isn't very good.  It really can't compete with the Starbucks canned & bottle releases.<br /><br />Nutrition: 100 calories and 18g of sugar is not that bad for a full coffee drink like this.  However, if you again compare it to the Starbucks Frappuccinos, it's not a big enough difference to warrant the nutrition difference.  The Frappuccinos contain only 50 more calories and 8g of sugar, but keep in mind the Starbucks bottle contains quite a bit more than these cans.<br /><br />Overall, while this Illy Issimo Cappuccino drink is convenient, the taste just isn't nearly good enough to compete with the at-home Starbucks releases.<br /><br />-AP3-",

The flavor is very similar to that which you would get from a high quality drip coffee that you could make at home.  Just add cocoa and chill and the flavor would be about the same.<br /><br />The good thing about the can size is that it fits very easily into a purse or backpack, the can is recyclable and there is no worry about breakage like with a bottled coffee.",

But I appreciate the fact that it was only moderately sweetened, much less so than sweetened coffee drinks you might find at a McDonalds or convenience store.  I also like that only a small amount of cocoa was added, preventing the drink from starting to resemble chocolate milk.  Unfortunately, there was also too little coffee flavor my taste.  I really wanted to taste at least some roasted flavor in the drink, but there was little to none of this.<br /><br />For those who want a mild lightly sweet coffee drink, illy issimo Cappuccino is certainly worth a try.

What I would add to that review is the following:  taste tests have proven time and time again (especially with beer) that beverages consumed out of a can often give the drinker a flavor of \"tininess\" ... however, since modern cans are lined with a plastic coating, this cannot be true ... the tinny flavor is actually in their head, or from the top of the can's exterior.  Further, when taste testers are served the same beer (Budweiser, Stella, Guinness, etc.) in two glasses (one poured from a can, and one poured from a bottle) they overwhelming choose the beer poured from the can.  This is because bottles leak sunlight and oxygen - two things that ruin beer.  Cans don't leak oxygen or sunlight, so a fresher, better tasting beer will always come from the can - so long as you don't drink it directly from the can.  The same is true with this product.  If you drink if from the can, you will always enjoy it less than a fresh cappuccino.  If you pour it in a cup or glass before serving it your friends will think you have a fancy machine in your kitchen.",

    "review_text": "A little background:  I own a Gaggia for illy espresso machine <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00416L8OQ\">Gaggia for Illy Espresso Machine</a> that works with illy single-serve pods <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CRE5D8\">illy iperEspresso Capsules Dark Roasted Coffee, 5-Ounce, 21-Count Capsules</a> <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CRAWCQ\">illy iperEspresso Capsules Medium Roasted Coffee, 5-Ounce, 21-Count Capsules</a>.  I like the flavor of illy espresso, but my favorite is still the Nespresso line of coffee <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UW1KLM\">Nespresso Citz D110 Espresso Machine, Silver Chrome</a>.  When I saw that Coca-Cola was distributing illy in-a-can from Denmark, I immediately thought it might be a nice cold drink for my early morning, one-hour commute into the city.<br /><br />This morning I pulled two cans from the frig and drank them as I drove to work.  I tasted both the \"cappuccino\" and the \"caffe\" flavors.  Here are my thoughts:  The coffee in these cans is nothing like what you make at home in your espresso machine--the richness is missing.  illy makes a medium and a dark roast.  The coffee in these cans are more like the medium roast--definitely not dark.  But, bottom line, coffee in a can tastes exactly as you feared it would:  Coffee with that \"special\" canned taste.<br /><br />Comparing the two flavors that I sampled this morning, I like the cappuccino better than the caffe <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA\">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.  I think the cappuccino works better than the caffe as a cold drink.  The cappuccino went down quickly and easily, but there was an aftertaste that I didn't quite like.  Even after finishing the second coffee (the caffe without milk), I could still taste the lowfat milk and it was not fresh-tasting.  I'm not used to sweetness in my espresso and the sugar in these cans made the coffee taste a bit tangy.  I did not notice any bitterness in either of the flavors.<br /><br />Be aware of the size of these cans:  They are not as large as soda pop cans.  They are narrow cans, with the cappuccino can about an inch taller than the caffe can.  I mention this because I had trouble finding a place to set in my vehicle's console because they are so narrow.  Your vehicle's can-holder space will be too large for these cans.  You  would have to wedge them in somehow to keep them from toppling.<br /><br />So, as with most everything else that you buy for convenience-sake, with these coffee drinks you sacrifice flavor for handiness.  If you really don't have time in the evening to put together a bottle of iced coffee for your morning commute, then the cappuccino is not a bad drink.  If you like a sweet coffee and if you like milk in your coffee, then the cappuccino is not a bad choice.  Personally, even though I don't have any extra time in the evening, I think I'll try to find the time to build myself an iced coffee for the morning--because I've just realized that it is very pleasant to have cold coffee to drink for my long commute, and canned coffee is not to my taste.",

    "review_text": "If you have an iced coffee flavor drink craving at 100 calories, this is not a bad idea (considering the alternative mega-calorie drinks at coffee chains). It has a little bit of everything, thus the 100 calories. The milk is low fat, so it has a more light watery milk taste. The sugar is there (18g) but flavor-wise it loses to the coffee+cocoa taste, which dominates. Flavor wise, this is closer to the coffee/espresso/cocoa side than the sugar/cream side. I personally don't find it creamy enough to call it a mocha (maybe a very light mocha). My preferred serving is in a small but tall glass with oblong ice cubes so the water melts and ices more uniformly.<br /><br />It comes in a recycable coffee-color-coded can which opens up top like a soda can.

One can is one serving, which is 8.45 fluid ounces, with 100 calories, 1.5g fat (1g saturated), 2% cholesterol, 3% sodium, 18g sugars, a little bit of fiber (under 1g), 4g protein, and 10% calcium.<br /><br />The caffeine is certainly there, 81mg in one can, it gives you a caffeine boost but it is not strong enough to turn you into Mad TV's Stan the Java man :)",

But for someone who's just a little bit of a coffee snob (you know, just endearingly, not enought to cross over into jerk territory), I was struck by how low-quality the ingredients taste. It's a very simple mix, with milk, coffee, sugar and whatever additives keep the stuff from going bad, but the coffee flavor immediately strikes me as being poor, even cheap. Perhaps this stuff flies in Europe, I don't know, but I was pretty disappointed. Just about everything else from Italy gets a much better score in my book.",

    "review_text": "I'm a very big consumer of caffiene beverages, drinking multiple beverages a day.  I'd always heard excellent things about illy issimo beverages.  Its interesting to note that as gourmet and Italian as the name may sound, the brand is owned by Coca Cola and is only distributed in the US and Japan.  Their website describes the brand as \"illy issimo offers a range of ready-to-drink coffee made with illy's unique blend of 100% natural Arabica coffee. illy issimo is made with the finest natural ingredients that create the pure pleasure of coffee and awaken the senses while you're on-the-go. illy issimo is sweetened with beet sugar, is Kosher certified and contains 15-110 calories per can.\"<br /><br />Having said that, the basis for the company seems to have been an Italian company named illycafe, SpA. This beverage came about through a partnership between Coca Cola and illycafe.<br /><br />To get a more honest assessment, I shared a can with several of my co-workers.  All of us agreed that the drink was tasty, refreshing and evocative in smell and texture.  I drank it at room temperature and I believe that may have been a mistake.  I also shook it, having missed the directions which specifically said not to shake it.<br /><br />In either case, I liked the beverage very much.  It was, perhaps, a little sweet for my tasates, but all of us (three of us) agreed that we would buy the drink again and recommend it.  I believe I may order a case for my office.<br /><br />Be aware that the chocolate taste really pops in this beverage.  It tastes a little heavy, like a 70% cocoa taste.  If you are one of those unfortunates that do not like chocolate or are indifferent to the taste, you may wish to look elsewhere (Amazon lists 14 different drinks).  For me, this one was great!",

    "review_text": "For this review I will compare illy's issimo Cappuccino Coffee Drink to another canned coffee drink I have often bought, the Starbuck's Doubleshot. I would consider these two coffee drinks to be close competitors in price and size.<br /><br />illy's canned issimo coffee drink is very tasty, is sweet but not overly so.  The illy drink is larger by volume (it's 8.45 oz to the Doubleshot's 6.5oz), so the illy drink has a more milky flavor--it also contains cocoa and so tastes a bit sweeter.<br /><br />As to caffeine content, the illy drink has 81mg, whereas the Doubleshot (per its name) has 130mg. So, in the Starbuck's drink you get more caffeine in fewer total fluid ounces. Thus the Starbucks Doubleshot has a stronger coffee taste than the illy issimo.<br /><br />For me then, the illy drink is better tasting however it does not provide as strong a caffeine punch as the Starbucks Doubleshot. Choosing between the two may be a matter of how much caffeine you feel you need at a given time. However on taste alone, illy's issimo beats the Starbucks Doubleshot.",

    "review_title": "Wake up and pop the can....",
    "review_text": "illy issimo Cappucino Coffee Drink provides that mix of expresso, milk, sugar, and cocoa that serves as a morning wake up for many Americans.<br /><br />At 100 calories per can, the buyer should expect a sweet taste, but it's balanced by the cocoa. To me it tastes more like a cold mocha than a cappucino.  Taste is relative (and surely based in part on what we're accustomed to drinking); I like it (and normally Peet's Italian Roast is my drink of choice).  But thanks to the calorie count, for me at least, it's a sometime treat and not a morning ritual.<br /><br />For those who choose to drink it regularly, the fact that it's preservative free and the lowfat milk is rBST-free should be a bonus.  Although this does mean that the cans are labeled with expiration dates.  And the 'do not shake' admonition does not indicate that the drink is carbonated; it's full almost to the brim and shaking causes the sugary milk to spew.<br /><br />The Cappucino Coffee Drink is most flavorful when served cold, and, be warned, those who choose to plop in a scoop of vanilla ice cream for an afternoon pick-me-up had best share.",

I'm not sure how they get it to taste so sweet and creamy with only 100 calories (15 from fat), but they do, and I'm not complaining.  Also - it's really convenient that the caffeine content is on the can -- it's 81 mg.  I'm on a caffeine restricted diet (doc wants 200 mg or less) so it's great that I didn't have to estimate.<br /><br />I missed the instructions that were RIGHT THERE on the can \"DO NOT SHAKE\" and shook it anyway.  Oops.  It's exploded just a bit on opening.  No major mess, but there was a bit. I'll remember next time.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a wonderful cold coffee drink to start your morning.  It doesn't taste overly processed like a \"coffee style drink\".  It tastes like a nice cold coffee+cream.  Love it, and will probably be having one every morning.  It's not cheap, but it's not starbucks pricing either ...",

The small size makes it very portable and packable in a cooler or lunch box.  It has 100 calories and 18g of sugar.  It's not a health drink, nor an energy drink, but a coffee drink meant to be enjoyed for a break or as a treat.<br /><br />I would never drink this room temperature, it would be too chalky tasting and would probably have a funny aftertaste.  However, I did drink this sample cold (from the can) and poured most of it over ice in a glass (was better from a glass).  I found it refreshing on a warm afternoon and it was a nice pick-me-up.  I could taste the coffee and I could taste the cocoa and the texture was quite smooth.<br /><br />I enjoyed this product and it's definitely something I will purchase in the future (though I'll look for the best price for my budget).",

I decided to give this cappuccino drink by illy issimo a chance since I've been trying a few new things lately (like how I had Doritos for the first time last week in my nearly 27 years of existence). My initial reaction was that it didn't taste very good, but again, that's probably because I don't drink coffee very much. But after a few sips, I got used to it. I'm not saying it tasted good by any means, but it's certainly not the worst thing I've drank this year. Coffee fans will either love or hate this, depending on their personal preferences.<br /><br />The nutrition info listed on the can is a bit reassuring, since this drink isn't that bad for you, and you get a little bit of protein too. It's fairly low in sugar for a drink like this too. And while it's not advertised as an energy drink, I actually felt upbeat for an hour or two after finishing the can...something I can't say for other drinks I've had like Mountain Dew or Jarritos.<br /><br />I'm giving it 3 stars because it's just plain ok in my book.

It gives me the option of just bringing it with me and drinking it when I'm ready rather than having to stand in line every morning (or buying a coffee maker) to get my morning shot of joe.<br />- The portion size (~8.5 ounces) is good.  I wouldn't mind an even larger size, but this size is big enough to get you going in the morning.<br /><br />Con:<br />- The coffee and chocolate flavors were too delicate for my taste.  I prefer the milder coffees, but this cappuccino was a little too mild for me.<br /><br />Neither a pro or con:<br />- You can drink the product cold from straight from your refrigerator, but in my opinion, it tastes better served over ice.<br /><br />Overall, in my opinion, this product's strength is its convenience and portability, and its weakness is that doesn't taste as good as the freshly-made alternatives.

    "review_text": "I received both the Caffe and Cappuccino versions and did a side-by-side taste comparison to see which of the two I might prefer over the other.<br /><br />First I tried the Caffe version and was surprised to discover it was just black coffee. I prefer cream in my coffee, so I was hesitant to taste it as it was. But I tasted it and found it to have a nice medium coffee strength with a bit of sweetness to it. In my everyday coffee I don't add sugar, but on occasion it's nice to have a special coffee drink, and since it's been hot here lately, I had poured it over ice as well. I added cream and found it to be quite enjoyable. It's one of those conveniences that one could easily become addicted to.<br /><br />Next I tried the Cappuccino which had a similar taste and flavor as the Caffe, but was milder. I prefer my coffee stronger, so my preference was for the Caffe and still I would have liked it stronger (perhaps this is offered in another version). But the Cappuccino was also good and I had poured it over ice as well. I was concerned about both coffees being packaged in cans as I don't like my drinks to have a metallic tinge to them, but I did not notice anything out of the ordinary. I had, however, poured the drinks over ice into a glass, so that may have helped. Regardless, it was really nice to have sitting out on my deck on a warm day. Hot coffee just does not sit well with me in hot weather.<br /><br />All-in-all, if you're looking for a mild, sweet coffee drink that's quick and easy to take with you on the go or to pour into a glass at home, this is a good choice. It's small and convenient to slip into a purse or briefcase. While the coffee is mild, it still gives a quick pick-me-up in the morning, or in the middle of the day if need be.",

    "review_text": "I enjoyed illy issimo coffee drink Cappucino flavor.  It isn't as icky sweet as some of the Starbuck frappucino's and such, so for me that's a plus.  It has a nice coffee flavor...not too bitter and just a small amount of sweetness.  This drink isn't for those of you who aren't really coffee lovers that only tolerate really sweet coffee drinks.  It tastes like coffee...just perfect for the true coffee lover.  The size is just right with 81 grams of caffeine for it 8.45 ounces.  This product is manufactured in Denmark for the Coca-Cola Company.  They are a little over $2 a piece on Amazon.  That's a little pricey for a regular habit, but it is much more competitive than a $5 drink at the coffee shops.<br /><br />Overall, it was tasty, and I would recommend it.",

    "review_title": "The illy issimo Cappuccino Tastes Sweeter and Creamier than the illy issimo Caff&egrave;, but Starbucks is Still Better!",
    "review_text": "Because I barely average six hours of sleep each night, I need a lot of coffee to keep me going throughout the day.  I love iced coffee during the warm summer months.  Many of the fast food chains are providing it.  Coca-Cola is now selling coffee in the can.  The illy issimo Cappuccino, manufactured by Coca-Cola, is much sweeter than the illy issimo Caff&egrave; [<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA\">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>].  The Cappuccino has a lot more sugar and milk than the Caff&egrave;, which is basically black coffee.  However, the Cappuccino still pales in comparison to other leading brands.  I have posted photographs of illy issimo Cappuccino alongside its leading competitors: Starbucks Doubleshot, Energy + Coffee Drink, Mocha [<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002U56LE2\">Starbucks Doubleshot, Energy+Coffee Drink, Mocha, 15 oz (Pack of 12)</a>], and Java Monster Coffee + Energy Drink, Loca Moca [<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IMBVJI\">Java Monster Coffee + Energy Drink, Loca Moca, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>].<br /><br />  I enjoy the sweet, creamy taste of illy issimo Cappuccino straight from its can or sipping it from a glass full of ice.  (See the photograph that I have posted on this website.)  However, it doesn't taste as delicious as the Starbucks Doubleshot.  (See my posted photograph.)  When compared to Starbucks and Java, the liquid in the glass is still darker than the others.  (See posted photograph.)  I don't think Starbucks has to worry about losing customers to Coca-Cola.  I'd rather go to the grocery store and buy coffee drinks manufactured by Starbucks instead of illy issimo.<br /><br />  Also, I don't quite understand why the cans of illy issimo say, \"Do Not Shake.\"  I posted a photograph of a glass bottle of Starbucks Frappuccino Mocha [<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018AIZKS\">Starbucks Coffee Frappuccino Coffee Drink Mocha, 9.5 Ounce Bottles-(pack of 12)</a>]; one can see that its contents have settled at the bottom.  I always shake my bottles and cans of coffee drinks before opening them.  The contents have never spewed like carbonated soda; instead, they have appeared slightly frothy.  However, I just remembered from looking at the ingredients (which I have posted on this website) that both illy issimo Caff&egrave; and illy issimo Cappuccino have potassium bicarbonate.  Perhaps the potassium bicarbonate will cause the coffee to spew if shaken.  Why do these products contain potassium bicarbonate?  Commonly found in club soda, potassium bicarbonate softens the affects of effervescence.  It is also used as a fire suppression agent (\"BC dry chemical\") in some dry chemical fire extinguishers.<br /><br />  Illy issimo Cappuccino is recommended for coffee drinkers who love sugar and cream in their coffee but think Starbucks has too much in their products.  Perhaps you are a long-term consumer of Starbucks products and you desire something different; illy issimo Cappuccino would be worth trying for a change.  I wonder if the Coca-Cola Museum in Atlanta, Georgia, will be offering free samples of the illy issimo coffee drinks.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos",

It's lightly sweetened (lightly being the operative word) and has no cream. I tried it two ways - first, I dumped a shot over vanilla ice cream. The bitter boldness went great with the smooth sweetness of the ice cream. Next, I tried it straight, then added cream to taste. It was excellent.<br /><br />If you're tired of all the corn syrup and icky creamers in so many of the packaged coffee drinks out there, give this one a \"shot\". It's just the right size for enjoying and it is great for coffee fans who are tired of the way Starbucks and others have turned coffee into a sickly-sweet milkshake-like experience.",

There is just the right balance of coffee and enough sugar to make it appealing but not so much that it overpowers the drink or leaves an aftertaste.  The convenience of popping open a can for a great tasting caffeine fix is appealing.  And a good jolt of caffeine it is:  155 mg. per 6.8 ounce serving.  (The size of the can.)  Compare that to 48 mg. per 16.9 ounces of caffeine in Coke Zero.<br /><br />The ingredient list is pretty simple: Coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate.<br /><br />If you're looking for a quick, bold, full-bodied, Italian espresso-style coffee drink, look no further.

    "review_text": "I like to have a few cold canned coffee beverages on hand, as I prefer them to most energy drinks. Unfortunately finding one that isn't filled with sweeteners has become very difficult.  Living in the Seattle area I was already familiar with illy for their <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DYUI\">coffee beans</a> that are used in some of my favorite coffee houses. So being given the chance to try some of their canned coffee beverages was something I was looking forward to.<br /><br />After spending the night in the fridge, I opened the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA\">illy issimo Caff&egrave;</a> without shaking it as noted on the can and poured it into a glass. (*See customer images) The color was very nice, it looked like a strong cup of coffee. The smell was good too and although I knew it was sweetened it wasn't coming across too much. The coffee was strong, very smooth and thankfully not too sweet. I was able to enjoy the entire can in one sitting.<br /><br />Overall illy issimo has a great product and for once I've found one that isn't too sweet for me to enjoy. Plus now that I have been introduced to their canned coffee line I am looking forward to trying this one next: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I2FGQE\">illy issimo Caff&egrave; (No Sugar)</a>",

    "review_text": "I had tried the illy issimo Cappuccino and found it to have a strong coffee flavor but with out much of an aftertaste, giving it what I assumed was it's \"Italian style\" coffee quote on the can.  But here with the illy issimo Caffe - the flavor is very bold and the taste sticks around.  Now for some, this is a definite plus.  I think this coffee is designed for coffee fans of bold flavors, dark roasts, French roasts, and especially espresso.  The sweetness is very light and almost vanishes before you can even realize it's there.  It gives you a nice smooth initial flavor, then the coffee comes over the top, dominating the taste.  To me this compares very nicely to Starbucks Doubleshot, except that this seems to have distinctively different coffee bean flavor that is hard to explain as different from Starbucks - but it is slightly.  As for the sweetness, here in the description as I write this - it says 45 calories.  It actually has 50 on the can.  So not for sure if this is an oversight or a recipe change.  Either way, this is definitely something for espresso fans.  If you are looking for a great pick me up during the sweltering summer, this is a nice alternative to hot coffee.  And price-wise, this may save you a few bucks over the price of Starbucks Doubleshot.",

    "review_text": "Not exactly the highest possible praise, but as something of a coffee snob, I was surprised to find this so palatable.  And really, if you need a caffeine hit, isn't it better to down something that didn't have to be formulated inside of a lab?  Five Hour Energy Drinks, I'm talking to *you*.<br /><br />What's in the can?  Coffee, beet sugar, potassium carbonate and potassium citrate.  Those last two you can buy in the vitamin/supplement aisle of your drugstore, and they do have natural antacid properties - I don't think they are used here as preservatives, but rather to tone down coffee's natural acidity.  I get good balance in the flavor of the coffee, so it's easy to enjoy without the addition of milk - great for me as a lactose-intolerant coffee drinker.  If you happen to already cold-brew in the fridge at home for lower acid, you'll appreciate the difference.  On the other hand, if you're a huge fan of bright, acid-y Central American coffees as opposed to the deeper Sumatrans and Suwalesis, then for you this might be a deficit.<br /><br />I'd keep this around in warm weather to offer iced to guests.  It's true that you can probably brew a better cup, if you start with good beans, but I think the convenience here is worth the price, particularly if you don't normally brew much coffee. Roasted beans kept in storage go stale - FAST.<br /><br />For decades, Illy has enjoyed a reputation for reliable, if not exceptional quality, and I'd sooner have one of these than a Starbucks canned or a McCafe any day. (Even if they did partner with Coca Cola for this latest Issimo line, says the coffee snob.)",

    "review_text": "Right up front: I like this drink, even though I usually don't want my coffee tampered with: No sugar, No milk or cream, No frothing, No cinnamon, No nonsense.<br /><br />This has a definite espresso flavor and is very sweet. The potassium bicarbonate and potassium citrate effectively cut the bitterness that one would expect. I poured the drink into a glass, and there was no aluminum can taste.<br /><br />Actually, since it is based on espresso, I found that half the can was enough for me. At another time I might enjoy a whole can (which is still less than 7 oz.) Even though was cold, I drank it like espresso--one sip at a time.<br /><br />My energy level usually slumps in the middle of the afternoon. I found that by taking a short break and _slowly_ drinking the illy issimo coffee drink, I was refreshed and ready to go on with my day. (Could they have found a more awkward name than: illy issimo Caffe Italian espresso style coffee drink?)<br /><br />But now the true test: Will I actually buy it? Yeah, the next time I go to my local supermarket I will check it out. If it is no more expensive than Amazon, I will probably buy some to have occasionally. (If you are not really out in the boonies, it just seems strange to buy food from Amazon--and I have bought a lot of different stuff from Amazon.)<br /><br />Notes: -->I noticed some other reviewers were drinking it (and it was suggested) when they were commuting or in a hurry. Drink brewed coffee then. Don't rush through espresso--that is just disrespectful. -->Also, on the can, the promise seems to be that the coffee itself is natural, not necessarily the whole product. -->Yes, I know that the energy boost was from relaxing, enjoying the drink, and the sugar, because it takes an hour for caffeine to actually kick in.",

I've tried many of both iced coffee beverages and coffees with espresso shots from the big chain, and I've found them completely delightful, though expensive. Unfortunately, this canned, low-calorie Italian espresso style coffee drink is a no-go for me.<br /><br />I'm assuming this is to be served cool from the refrigerator, although I'm certain my reaction wouldn't be any different had I drank it at room temperature. The texture is unsatisfactorily grainy. The flavor is unpleasantly off, either from beans that aren't bold enough or from a mixture of ingredients that ruins the flavor of a good bean - either way, I didn't enjoy it.<br /><br />It's a 50 calorie beverage; with a low 20mg sodium and 12g in carbs, so it balances out nutritionally for a coffee drink. The beet sugar is where it gets its 4g of fiber, its 10g of sugars and likely the peculiar graininess.<br /><br />This is a convenient on-the-go option for someone who likes coffee, but I like coffee, and I do not like this.",

    "review_text": "Okay, I admit that I'm a bit of a coffee snob. Enough so that I roast my own beans and grind them fresh before each cup and I look down a bit on Starbucks and Peet's. Still, just like I believe wine in a bag or box could be good if you actually use good wine - better, maybe, depending on the wine and what you intend to use it for - I also believe that using good beans and processing them properly you could, maybe, get an excellent cup of coffee in a can.<br /><br />Normally I wouldn't be trying coffee in a can simply because it usually seems to have milk in it and I don't consume any dairy, but this illy issimo contains just coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, and potassium citrate. I'm not sure what the last two ingredients are for, but wikipedia says they both impart a slightly salty taste and are used to regulate ph...so maybe it's either of those or both. The can says \"100% natural arabica\". Not sure what the \"natural\" part is supposed to mean - maybe it's just a way to sneak \"natural\" onto the label - it's a term that's not really regulated so it's slapped on a lot of stuff without really meaning anything. Not too impressed with the \"arabica\" part...75% of all coffee produced is arabica and some of it is pretty nasty dross. Still, illy is supposed to have a good reputation, so despite the meaningless hype on the can I have tentative high hopes for it.<br /><br />These cans are kind of small, closer to a Red Bull than your traditional can of soda. I put my can in the fridge to chill it, then opened it and took a sip. Well, blech...I did not like that at all, but then I normally don't like coffee and sugar without any (non-dairy) milk, so not really a surprise. I put four ice cubes in a glass and then the coffee and it filled my glass most of the way. The rest of the glass I filled with one of my two favorite soy milks, Sunrich Naturals (which is the one they use at Blue Bottle) gave a little stir and sipped again. This time, it actually tasted good! Good enough to drink the entire thing, even though really I'd had my coffee for the day. Oh yeah, and better than an iced latte from Peet's or Starbucks!<br /><br />Would I drink this again? Yes, actually I would. The main thing stopping me would be that I'd only want to drink it if I had access to a glass with ice and some soy (or other non-dairy) milk, which certainly could happen but if I'm at home I might just as well roast and grind my own beans and if I'm not at home all of a sudden the whole ice/glass/soymilk thing requires some pre-planning. They should make illy issimo canned coffee drinks with soymilk right in the can...then I bet I could think of lots of reasons to keep a case of it on hand.",

    "review_text": "I received both the Caffe and Cappuccino versions and did a side-by-side taste comparison to see which of the two I might prefer over the other.<br /><br />First I tried the Caffe version and was surprised to discover it was just black coffee. I prefer cream in my coffee, so I was hesitant to taste it as it was. But I tasted it and found it to have a nice medium coffee strength with a bit of sweetness to it. In my everyday coffee I don't add sugar, but on occasion it's nice to have a special coffee drink, and since it's been hot here lately, I had poured it over ice as well. I added cream and found it to be quite enjoyable. It's one of those conveniences that one could easily become addicted to.<br /><br />Next I tried the Cappuccino which had a similar taste and flavor as the Caffe, but was milder. I prefer my coffee stronger, so my preference was for the Caffe and still I would have liked it stronger (perhaps this is offered in another version). But the Cappuccino was also good and I had poured it over ice as well. I was concerned about both coffees being packaged in cans as I don't like my drinks to have a metallic tinge to them, but I did not notice anything out of the ordinary. I had, however, poured the drinks over ice into a glass, so that may have helped. Regardless, it was really nice to have sitting out on my deck on a warm day. Hot coffee just does not sit well with me in hot weather.<br /><br />All-in-all, if you're looking for a mild, sweet coffee drink that's quick and easy to take with you on the go or to pour into a glass at home, this is a good choice. It's small and convenient to slip into a purse or briefcase. While the coffee is mild, it still gives a quick pick-me-up in the morning, or in the middle of the day if need be.",

I don't mind the strange aftertaste that much since the drink is Kosher, has only 10 grams of sugar and 50 calories.  The best part of this coffee drink is the rich, full bodied espresso flavor.

    "review_text": "I enjoy my coffee but I normally add only a touch of sugar, if any at all to my coffee. When I do add sugar, I would put no more than a 1/2 teaspoon of sugar in my cup of coffee. I also will generally choose a dark roast coffee, like French Roast or Sumatra.<br /><br />This illy Caffe coffee drink is an Italian Roast coffee. It has a decent taste in my opinion. I was expecting some sort of \"canned\" taste but didn't sense that at all while I was drinking it. But I did experience an aftertaste that I can only describe as somewhat metallic.<br /><br />I usually drink the dark roast coffees but was surprised to find that this had a really  nicely balanced coffee taste without the pronounced bitterness usually associated with the bigger, bolder dark roasts to which I'm accustomed.<br /><br />It was the added sugar that I don't really care for. The serving size is 6.8 fluid ounces and that contains 10g of sugar. A teaspoon of sugar is approximately 4 g which means this 6.8 oz can of coffee has the equivalent of 2.5 teaspoons of sugar. Even if I did put sugar in a cup of coffee, I'd only put in a single teaspoon. So for me it was way too sweet. Knowing that many people do sweeten their coffee, I'd say that many people would not find this as overly sweet as I did. You'd probably like it if you sweeten your coffee.<br /><br />I find it convenient to be able to have with you on trips or travels, a good quality cup of coffee. This tastes much better to me than your typical gas station swill that is passed on as coffee. So for trips or commutes it would be a great choice. Just be careful if you are diabetic or have sugar restrictions because there is quite a bit of sugar in a serving. Other than that it tastes pretty good to me.",

Since this is so entirely a matter of taste and budget, I'll say I really like the taste but continue to roll my eyes at the prices - comparable to the Starbucks canned products you see at the grocery stores.

But tasting it later I came to appreciate the flavor.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of canned/bottled coffee drinks, to me this tasted like real coffee. Nice and strong, not too sweet. If you put a lot of sweet-and-white in your coffee, you will find this drink unbearably bitter, in that case I recommend the Cappucino version of the same brand.<br /><br />Nutrition facts: 50 calories in the can, 20mg sodium, 12 carbs (10g sugars, 1g fiber) -- which isn't bad. Caffeine content is 155 mg in the 6.8 fl oz. The ingredients list coffee, sugar, potassium bicarbonate, and potassium citrate. No milk, which is healthier, and I prefer that because I'm lactose intolerant. It also means it lasts longer -- the best-by date on my sample can is Sept. '12 (received April).<br /><br />The can lists this nice coffee as a Product of Denmark. I've tasted coffee in Denmark, and I can't dispute that, though I can tell you this method is a whole lot cheaper.<br /><br />I drank it cold and I really enjoyed this coffee. I would really like to get more... but it is a bit pricy. If you are on the go a lot this is an easy solution.",

    "review_text": "I drink a good bit of coffee, most of it iced, so I was expecting something decent with the illy issimo Coffee drink. To my dismay, I didn't like it...at all. It's basically an iced, sweetened coffee drink around espresso strength. The drink had that stale, \"I've been sitting for a while\" coffee taste that is best poured down a drain. The sweetness is about right (not cloying or overpowering) and it definitely tastes like espresso, but it just doesn't taste like fresh brewed (maybe yesterday). I know it comes in a can and technically can't be fresh, but I've tasted similar coffee drinks that didn't have that stale, skunky taste. It gets two stars for giving a decent energy/caffeine boost, but the taste makes it impossible to recommend.",

This has no dairy type ingredients, so you will either need to drink this \"black\" or add something to it.  I tried it straight out of the can into a glass, chilled.  It was really strong, as in very bitter.<br /><br />I softened it a bit by adding some skim milk and sugar.  Even though this is sweetened with beet sugar, the bitterness far overpowers any hint of sweetness.  I added about 3 teaspoons of sugar, and then used about two ounces of milk mixed with this 6.8 ounce can. That made it more palatable.  I then added some crushed ice and poured some over the ice.  Better yet.<br /><br />All in all I would say this is for only hard core iced coffee drinkers.  If you lean more toward a sweet coffee with lots of sugar, this probably isn't going to be up your alley.<br /><br />But if you are an iced coffee drinker and like the bold taste of espresso, you might want to give this a whirl.",

Today's temperature touched 100 so ice cold was the order of the day.  I have a special fast chill compartment in my refrigerator that cools items quickly to 34 degrees and after 4 hours in there I put the can in the freezer for 5 minutes.  It was icy cold the way I like it.  THe espresso is strong and bold without bitterness.  I liked the slight hint of sweetness as I find many coffee drinks to be too sweet for my taste but the Illy Issimo was spot on.  Compared to a Starbucks Double Shot the Illy has a better, more well-rounded flavor.<br /><br />Ok, I raved about the product so why only 4 stars?  The price!  In this age of Starbucks, etc., we are getting used to paying astronomical prices for coffee.  Folks, this is good espresso and convenient in the can but it is still coffee.  I guess we like to pay for convenience.  I could make Illy espresso in my Gaggia Baby for pennies a shot but sticking a can in the fridge is more convenient.

After drinking this espresso drink, I now understand the flavor they talk about - and oddly enough, the first thought that came to my mind when I drank this was, \"Wow, this tastes like a beer.\" (not in the boozy sense, mind you - just the bitter bite and flavor overtones).<br /><br />There is a twinge of sweetness to the drink, but nothing that I would consider having a major impact. The bitterness is pretty impressive considering that this small can has 10g of sugar - to put that into perspective, it has about half the sugar of a normal Coke.<br /><br />Now... the caffeine part.<br /><br />I don't really get much caffeine any more - I used to drink tons when I was a kid - going through multiple six-packs of Coke in a week. Nowadays the only caffeine I get is from iced tea at a restaurant (unsweet). So maybe it's because my tolerance is now a bit lower than it used to be, but this thing kicks like a mule. I drank the espresso about three hours after eating lunch, and I would say that I felt the impact within ten minutes of finishing off the can. It stuck with me for about an hour too. Oddly enough, the cappuccino version of this drink took a few hours for me to feel the caffeine high. I checked out the can and found out why... pregnant women and people with heart issues should probably stay very far away from this drink.<br /><br />Here are some basic caffeine stats from the Mayo Clinic:<br />Drink  Size  Caffeine<br />5-Hour Energy  2 oz. (60 mL)  207 mg<br />Red Bull  8.4 oz (250 mL)  76-80 mg<br />Coca-Cola Classic  12 oz. (355 mL)  30-35 mg<br />Mountain Dew  12 oz. (355 mL)  46-55 mg<br /><br />This little can is 6.8 fl oz (200mL) and contains 155 mg of caffeine.<br /><br />If you're a big coffee drinker who takes a lot of their coffee strong and black, these numbers won't come as much of a shock to you since it's pretty much in line with normal brewed coffee. However, if you're no longer a caffeine junkie, don't be surprised if you suddenly feel the need to run a marathon.<br /><br />My final verdict is that I like this stuff, although in the future I'd probably tend to stick more with the sweeter Mochas and Cappuccinos. If you're not a fan of the bitter coffees, I can't say I'd recommend this drink for you, but I didn't find the flavor as off-putting as many other reviewers seem to have.",

The soy ingredients don't bother me as much as the food coloring does. (Added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6 and other color).  The green peas and vegetables in the mix aren't really veggies, but a kibble formed into vegetable shapes and colored to look like vegetables. I wish pet food manufacturers would spend less on making dog food look appetizing to humans and more in making it healthy for our pets.<br /><br />Although beef is the first ingredient on the list, most of the rest are grain products including soy, corn and rice. One of our dogs sometimes has a sensitive stomach and it's probably all the soy that doesn't always agree. Another ingredient is animal digest which could contain goodness knows what. I think I prefer the limited ingredient types of foods that my dogs normally eat, ones where I can recognize all the ingredients and they don't sound like something I wouldn't want to eat.",

I think you could color it green and call it roadkill and the dogs wouldn't know the difference. Yeah, I know , all of the hype is for the purchaser.<br /><br />As for the ingredients, what do I know? The ingredients are listed on the product page if you find that helpful. I sort of think it's like reading the ingredients on \"all ground beef patties\" then discovering part of the beef is \"pink slime\". The food is rated 1 star when compared to others which doesn't sound so great to me.<br /><br />I just have to trust that the researchers and developers at Purina know what is good for animals. The little \"bean and potato garnish\" are a crunchy dry food and the \"meat\" looking pieces have sort of a rubbery play-dough texture. Maybe a little easier for older dogs to chew.<br /><br />The bottom line: My dog eats it and it seems to agree with her.  She will usually only eat dry food if I mix a spoonful of science diet cat food in it .",

    "review_text": "\"Grilled Sirloin\" sounds great for a dog food, and my dog was sniffing the package and followed me from the door to the kitchen with intense interest. He was more interested in this food than many types of treats he has had. So, if your dog is a picky eater who would lose weight rather than eat a food that doesn't interest it (I have had a dog like this), then this might be a viable choice for you in order for you to get your dog to eat.<br /><br />On the flip side, if your dog has no problems at mealtimes and you want to provide him/her a healthy meal at a fair price, you may want to keep looking. My dog eats 4 cups of his regular food, maintains his weight and energy and has good stools. With this food, he needs about seven cups and a couple more trips outside each day. More food and more waste, because less food/volume is being absorbed by the dog. Less nutrition and more fillers. Pet food manufacturers often split up a filler food into separate types (soy meal/soy flour) so that a meat type will move to first in line of ingredients. First up is \"Beef\" although not specified as grilled sirloin or not, it is still generally better than foods that start with four types of corn product or a meat byproduct. This also has poultry byproduct meal, plus 3 soy ingredients, 2 wheats, brewers rice, corn, barley,  and 4+ artificial colorings. While it is not the worst dog food on the market, it is certainly not the best, and certainly not at this price point. Your dog will probably love this stuff -kind of like how people love junk food.",

The bits that represented steak went first.  The last bit was the green things-- which is kind of amusing because I once had a dog who absolutely refused to eat the green round things in Beneful.  She would delicately pick out all of the green things and leave them scattered around her bowl.  So when I found the green things from this brand scattered around I wondered if Lucy's ghost had shown up to protest.  Shortly after that I noticed that one of the dogs had finally eaten them.<br /><br />No one developed any stomach problems or itchies after eating it so it has a thumbs up from a human and pricked ears from three dogs.",

I'll be truthful - my dog loved this and ate it happily.  I mixed it it with his regular dog food and he just gobbled it right up.  However, my dog doesn't do well on foods loaded with grains so I won't likely be buying this despite how much he loved it.  Here are the ingredients in order by weight:<br /><br />Beef  - good to see it's the Number 1 ingredient but from her, it gets sketchy<br />Soybean meal<br />Soy Flour<br />Animal fat<br />Brewers Rice (an empty calorie filler leftover from Beer making process)<br />Soy Protein Concentrate<br />Corn Gluten Meal (another filler)<br />Ground Yellow Corn (filler)<br />Glycerin<br />Poultry By Product - (ground up bones and feathers)<br />Ground Wheat<br />Animal Digest (??? I think I know what this is and it makes me sick)<br />Pearled Barley (Grains again)<br />Calcium Carbonate (ground up rocks)<br />Calcium Phosphate (ground up rocks)<br />Salt<br />Grilled Siloin Steak FLAVOR (no meat)<br />Dried Grean Beans<br />Dried Potatoes<br />Sulfur, Vitamin E,<br /> Choline Chloride,<br /> Zinc Sulfate,  Ferrous Sulfate (both colorants)<br />Added colors - about 5<br />Niacin<br />Wheat Flour (grains again)<br /> and so on and so forth.. the same as basically what's in Beneful.<br /><br />My advice - if you have to go with a Grocery Store brand, don't be folled by a fancy photo on the bag of Sirloin Steak.  Compare the ingredients and buy what you can get the most of for your money IF YOUR DOG CAN EAT THAT STUFF.  Mine can but I still go the extra mile and try and by a more meat based diet.  While I was pleased that Beef was the first ingredient, I prefer to see the first few ingreidents be meat and never to see fillers like Corn and Brewers Rice.<br /><br />So  2 stars for taste, 1 star for being the same as every grocery store brand from Purina who makes this and  two stars OFF for deceptive packaging and advertising.

They are counting on pretty packaging with healthy claims distracting people from the actual ingredient list that contradicts those claims.  The feeding instructions say that you should feed your dog 1 cup for each 10 pounds of body weight, which means my 70 pound Lab would go through 7 cups of this junk food a day and at 22 cups of it a bag, would last her 3 days.

When I first put some of this food in his bowl, he ate it up in no time and came sniffing around the bag for more. He's a big dog and eats a couple of good sized scoops of dry food each day, so this 4.5 pound bag lasted less than a week. It would last longer for a smaller dog and I'll buy a bigger bag next time I get some.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about this dog food is the bag.  It has to be cut open, which is slightly less convenient than just ripping it or pulling on a string, but not a big deal. I also wish the bag were resealable with a Ziploc-type closure. I have to either transfer this food to another container once opened, or fold it up just so and push the open end against the wall to keep it shut. The bag, however, is not a deciding factor when I'm looking for a food my dog enjoys. I'll certainly consider this dog food in the future.",

They went for this food vs their regular food (lamb and rice flavored kibble).<br />But what this does is appeal to the owner who will visually agree to the packaging and the idea of feeding sirloin to their pets.<br />All in all, this is a fancy type of dog food, that smells very strongly (makes dogs love it more), but it as taken over the pantry and do not want this, therefore becoming unappealing to the owner.<br />The food is slightly rubbery, and seems to be semi-dry, vs regular dry dog food.<br />Also the package says to feed your dog 1 cup for every 10 lbs, that means my dogs would be eating 8 cups a day...each! I disagree with this.<br />This is a good treat for my dogs but prefer not to spoil them with this food.<br />Your dogs will love it, it just depends if you want to spend on and feed them this food.",

    "review_text": "When it comes to dog food, as you can see with the many reviews on Purina Chef Michael's products, you have passionate pet owners who are concerned about their dogs health and feeding them the best food possible.<br /><br />I admire pet owners who can do just that, as I know many who prefer to cook their dogs meal to those who will splurge in order to make sure their dogs eat the best and are healthy.  But with today's economy, I also know that there are owners who can't cook, can't splurge and try to look for the best price that they can to feed their dog(s).<br /><br />Purina's Chef Michels brand sounds like gourmet food for the dogs.  But looking at the price, how can gourmet food be so cheap?  Well, for the Grilled Sirloin Steak Flavor dog food which comes with potato & green bean garnishes, there is no doubt that many dogs will eat it.<br /><br />Ingredients are: Beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, salt, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, natural filet mignon flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6 and other color), sulfur, zinc sulfate, Vitamin E supplement, ferrous sulfate and many more.<br /><br />My small adult Pug-tzu's love eating this dry dog food.  It's small and at first they sniffed it but after 10 minutes or so, they began scarfing it down.  I did mix it with other dog food but on its own, I'm sure they enjoy it.  And what I like about it is that Amazon offers it for under $10, Purina does say they use real beef and the crunchy kibbles includes 23 essential vitamins and minerals.  Granted, after eating this, they also tend to have more stools.  I also want to note that my dogs did not produce any horrid flatulence after eating this dog food, like others have reported.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />I'm not an erudite when it comes to what is healthy for dogs and what isn't.  There are many reviews from hardcore dog lovers that you can read on this product to know that many have chimed in and called this \"junk food\" for their dogs.<br /><br />But I also feel that there are many people out there who are dog owners who can't afford to pay so much for their dog's food and the price of this dry dog food is quite appealing.  Purina does claim this particular Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin dry dog food does include 23 essential vitamins and nutrients.<br /><br />So, for the pet owners who are very budget-conscious, are looking for dry dog food that their small dogs will enjoy but also getting the essential vitamins in their meal, then Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog food may be for you.",

It actually smelled kind of good. The true test would be how my dogs liked it and if it caused gas and an upset stomach. They ate the food up immediately and were searching for more. Fortunately,Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin didn't upset their stomach one bit! No gas, good solid poop and happy dogs! My only complaint is that the bag doesn't have a gripper seal. I had to find another container to keep it in, which is a bit of a bummer, but I'd much rather find a container than clean up after a sick dog. I'll be sure to get this food again in the future.",

When this came and we filled his bowl with it the first time, I fully expected him to possibly take a couple of bites then refuse to eat any more.  I was shocked when he ate the entire bowl then went to his food container, basicly asking for more.  I gave him another cup of the food, he ate most of that before he laid down again.  I was thrilled to find another food that he liked!<br />After 3 or 4 days of him eating this food, he started having REALLY bad gas.  Imagine a 100 lb dog with bad gas laying next to where you are sitting on the couch!  Nevermind, you don't want to imagine that but you get my point.  After 4 days of dealing with the gas from hell we put him back on his old food.  Viola, gas was gone!  Thank God!  I don't know if that's a common reaction to the food but it certainly didn't agree with our dog's tummy.  Good news is that the outside cats like it and if they have gas, too, I don't have to deal with it.  ;-)",

Heck, I have 2 cats and even they enjoy snacking on it when the dog isn't around. Perhaps it isn't ideal nutrition, but I don't think it is as bad as some other reviewers have made it out to be. In any event, this is more of a treat food than a diet staple, and when viewed in that light, it is actually healthier and much more cost effective than many of those little packages of doggie treats that line the grocery store shelves.<br /><br />Place a serving of this next to a bowl of \"healthy\" store brand dog food and there is no comparison. Aesthetically it looks better, but I know that isn't what dogs care about. The bowl of Chef Michael's food will be eaten first every time. My suggestion is to either mix it in with your regular dry food, or use it as a treat. If you are overly concerned by the ingredients in your pet's food, then you may find issue with this brand. Also, there is no \"zip-lock\" to re-seal it so you'll need a large, strong clip to keep the bag closed. Or you can use an large plastic container like I do. Otherwise, this pet food gets two paws up!",

    "review_text": "I had both of my golden retrievers try the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food to see if they would like it.  The 8 month old overgrown puppy will eat almost anything and he loved this dog food, which I expected him to do.  I wasn't so sure about the 9 year old \"picky\" eater, but she really liked this food, as well!  She will eat her regular dry kibble, but not until she is really hungry, and she will often skip one of her twice daily feedings after checking to see what is in her food bowl.  The morning she found Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin in her dish, she sniffed it, looked at me (I'm pretty sure she smiled) and proceeded to gobble up the food.  Of course her \"brother\" had already inhaled his and was hoping for more!<br />  This dry food is not shaped like regular kibble, in that every piece does not look or feel the same.  The best way I can describe it is to say that it looks like \"dehydrated\" beef stew.  The pieces of meat are irregularly shaped and flatter than most kibble, and the veggies (mainly peas and carrots) really look like vegetables.  I would describe the texture as thick, solid \"flakes\" rather than round or square pieces of kibble.  I detected no odor, although it must smell wonderful to the dogs.<br />  I have not used the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin for the dog's regular feedings as one dog is still eating puppy food and the other eats senior formula, so I can't really comment on the nutrition value, or how this food affects their canine digestive tracts.  What I can comment upon, is how much both dogs loved this food.  I've been using a handful at a time as \"training rewards\" and both dogs like the Chef Michael's food as much as their regular treats.  We can keep the dogs' regular bags of food on a closet floor to which the dogs have full access, but I've had to hide the Chef Michael's food, since I found a large golden head in the bag!  A 4.5 bag is not going to last very long at our house.<br />  I plan to discuss the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Food with my vet before feeding it to the dogs on a regular basis, but if she oks it, I will definitely purchase this dry food and add another star to my rating.  (Hopefully, it is also sold in a 20lb or 40lb size).  Until then, I'll use it as treats for the dogs, or for \"dessert\" on top of their present food.  If my \"picky dog,\" who often refuses regular dog treats, eats Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food, it's obviously yummy!",

With this dog food being multi-colored and having beef pieces I was hoping he would eat all of it.<br /><br />Tequila perked up the second I opened the bag. You could tell that he loved the smell. I gave him one of the beef chunks and he immediately devoured it. I filled his bowl with the food and he excitedly ran over to it and started eating. When I walked into the kitchen later, there were hard brown chunks of food placed everywhere throughout the room. Dang dog! He did eat everything else in the bowl. So, he likes it better than a lot of other dog foods. As far as I know, there is not a dog food on the market that he will eat all of....so it gets four paws up from him.

    "review_title": "Dogs love it",
    "review_text": "There are two components of a review about dog food for me:  Do the dogs like it?  And is it good for them?<br /><br />To answer the first, my dogs LOVE it.  We had just finished a bag of feed so I opened this and they instantly started smelling the air as I poured it from the bag into their feed container.  From there I scooped out their usual quantity into each bowl and where they usually follow me with interest to where I set the bowls down for them to eat, this time they fairly pranced - leaping up and down with excitement at the \"treat\" that was in store for them.  On their old food, they would eat until they were full but often wander away with a little food left in the bottom to come back to later.  This time, they finished the bowl and then licked it clean.  So it certainly passed the taste test.<br /><br />Next is the question as to whether or not it is good for them.  I gave it a 4 because the overall ingredients are not terrible.  The first ingredient is meat - the first rule of thumb for me in any pet food.  However the second two ingredients are soy products, followed by brewers rice, more soy and then corn.  Included in the ingredients is also wheat.  So although it starts well, with Beef as the first ingredient, in the end it is bulked out by grains of all sorts, which lower the production costs for the manufacturer and keep the food priced lower for the consumer but also lowers the nutritional benefit to the animal.<br /><br />One last comment.  My first impression when I scooped the food into the bowls was that it is designed to look like a stew. Visually, it contains brown chunks - the meat - small green balls - the peas - and similarly sized yellow balls - the corn.  The problem is that a bowl of stew containing meat, peas and corn sounds yummy to us and is, in fact, designed to appeal to US visually - but is NOT a diet I would feed my dogs.  And, since dogs rely on smell more than vision, the visual appeal would be lost on them.  So I guess I didn't really appreciate what felt like a \"trick\" to get us to think of this as a good wholesome food for the dogs.",

    "review_title": "Gourmet Supermarket Kibble",
    "review_text": "If you feed your dog Supermarket grade kibble, then this might be a step up for your dog in taste if not nutrition.  Two of my dogs loved it, the third, who has a sensitive stomach, didn't really care for it.  It has nuggets that look like vegetables and others that look like bits of meat although the distinction is purely cosmetic.  The meaty bits are supposed to be tender but they felt as hard and crunchy as the rest of the nuggets.<br /><br />Also, the protein content is pretty high at a minimum of 28%.  I know, we have been told by dog food companies of late, that our dogs crave meat and lots of it.  The truth of the matter is that too much protein can damage your dog's kidneys.  Sadly, we found this out the hard way with our beloved Shiloh.  The pain and expense of having a dog suffer through kidney failure is significant and not something I would want to go through again.  Our vet told us that we should switch to a kibble with a protein content in the range of 18-20% and to get out of the habit of feeding our dogs high protein treats like jerky and pig's ears.  I don't know, but you might want to talk to your vet about it before switching.<br /><br />Now on the other hand, if you feed your dog premium dog food or organic premium dog food, then I would definately not advise switching.  Our vet also recommends organic natural dog food based on a suspected link between preservatives and fillers used in cheaper dog food and certain types of cancer in dogs.  Some articles I've read in various dog magazines have also reported the link between preservatives in dog food and cancer in dogs.  Again, you might want to discuss this with your vet.  Also, FYI I'm suspicious of any vet who tends to only recommend the brand of dog food that they sell at their office.  So, if this happens to you you might want to do your own research on line just make sure your truely getting an unbiased opinion.<br /><br />So anyway, I had been feeding our dogs the \"good stuff\" for several years but my husband would frequently comment (which in guy speak is like complaining) on the doggy food bill.  He ultimately suggested that we give this stuff a try because, after all, Chef Michael feeds it to his dog.  So I tried it and well, I'm sorry to have to tell you this dear but we're switching back to the premium stuff.",

When I filled my shih tzu's bowl with this, however, he simply looked at me, down at the bowl, gave it a sniff and walked away.  Granted, he is a very very very picky dog.  So far the only dog food that I have found that he really loves is Purina Beneful.  I have tried giving him this a couple of times and none of the times has he taken any interest in eating it.  Our cats, on the other hand, have nibbled on it and they don't seem to mind it.  I think this will end up going out to our big outside dogs - they love and eat anything, lol.  Bottom line, I will not be purchasing this in the future.",

However, my dogs LOVE this stuff, so I see two good uses for it:<br /><br />1.  Add a small handful as a flavor booster to their regular kibble.<br /><br />2.  Because it's easy to handle plus chewy and not crunchy, it makes for great rewards during agility training.<br /><br />If I were using it strictly for their regular food I'd give it a lower rating (because of price), but for the purposes I just stated, I think it's excellent and therefore I'll give five stars.  A bag of this stuff on hand is a lot cheaper than the other products I've been using for agility training rewards!",

    "review_text": "I often wonder how much time is invested in making dog food look like something we feel better about giving to our pets. This food looks nice, different colors, 'meaty' looking moist chunks and my dog loves eating it.<br /><br />It's over $2 a pound so it should be great right?<br /><br />But, after reading up on the food at dog food advisor dot com I would never get this food again. It can be deceiving that beef is the first ingredient. But as it is explained in the review at dog food advisor, that is the weight of the beef before drying and processing - which contains a lot of water. So after processing, it is probably a much lower percentage of ingredient. Then there were other questionable ingredients including animal fat - the origin can be from a number of gross places, and a high corn meal content.<br /><br />So, I think much of the high price comes from the processing to make it look better to us and therefore make us feel better giving it to our dogs.<br /><br />I think I'm going back to my 4/5 star Kirkland dog food.",

When I was offered the opportunity to review this dog food, I thought Buck was in for a treat from some fancy dog food - a nice change from the usual kibble. And, my first impression, when I opened the bag of dog food, was \"Oh, this looks good.\"<br /><br />But, it was all downhill from there. First I looked on the bag to see how much I was supposed to feed my dog. One cup per 10 pounds. One cup per 10 pounds! That's 8 cups/day for my large dog. There's a lot of filler in this dog food. I feed 3 1/2 cups/day of my regular dog food.<br /><br />So, I thought maybe the Chef Michael's would be better used as a replacement for just a small portion of the regular food to give Buck a treat. Based on the appearance, I was sure it must taste good. Much to my surprise, my dog did not really care for this dog food. He didn't hate it and did eventually eat what I put out, but was not at all enthusiastic about it.",

The yellow and green kibbles are of a typical kibble texture and a nice size for a treat for a dog up to about 50 pounds.  The softer, squishy \"meaty\" looking pieces are of variable size.  Most are larger than the hard kibbles.  Some are quite small -- there will be a very small portion of the bag that ends up as topping for a meal.  Nutritionally and economically, it is not as good as the Eukanubia I use as my dogs' main diet.  So I do recommend this for use as a training treat!",

Really?  I'm guessing that isn't natural food color there but added to make the food look more appetizing to humans.  I'm not a natural health food nut by any stretch of the imagination but even the skeptic in me thinks that at a minimum, they are spending a lot of money on the appearance of the food where I would rather know that that money was going towards nutrition.<br /><br />Finally, I can't be sure but I do believe my dogs are actually \"passing a lot more gas\" since they have been eating this food.

We made a mistake and fed our dog human food for the majority of his lifetime, which he then developed an obvious taste for people food and would turn down any dog food we tried to feed him. We've tried tons of $$$ worth of dog food that he just sniffed and left, and Chef Michael's he actually eats when hes hungry.<br /><br />We went through two rotisserie chicken bags that he finished and now he's about halfway done with the beef one. I cannot tell which one my dog prefers but I would highly recommend to buy both of them to give yours a variety rather than just one flavor for their lifetime.<br /><br />I would 100% recommend this dog food for your dog.

The result, she eats because she's hungry, but doesn't really enjoy it.<br /><br />Well, I can say that all that has changed!<br /><br />First and foremost, Chef Michael's dog food actually looks good.  Now, while I don't think the dog cares what the food looks like, it's still impressive for the doggie owner.<br /><br />Second, it actually smells good.  No dog food reek here.<br /><br />Third, the dog loves it.  From a dog who usually picks at her food, I now have a dog who devours her food.  LOL - as a matter of fact, I was awakened to the sound of the dog food bowl being pushed across the kitchen floor as someone looked for more food!<br /><br />And fourth and finally - the scoop on the poop!  I'm happy to say that the Dog-arrhea that usually comes with a change in food is non-existent.  Since I'm the one who has to scoop the poop before the gardener comes every week, let me just say that back yard clean up is a breeze.  And when the dog uses the pads on occasion, it's a super easy - and not at all smelly - clean up.<br /><br />So, with apologies for all the images this review may have brought to mind, but this is a really great dog food!",

    "review_text": "Unless you are already feeding your dog a low end dog food, Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin is not something I'd recommend feeding to your pet.<br /><br />I try to feed our dog better grade dog food.  Right now he is eating Castor and Pollux Natural Ultramix.  There are several other high quality pet foods available.<br /><br />If you'd rather skip this review and are looking for a better quality dog food, there are several out there, some of which strive to serve \"natural/organic\" products.  Here are justa few, listed alphabetically:  Blue Buffalo, Castor and Pollux, Merrick (who recently merged with Castor and Pollux), and Wellness.<br /><br />Chef Michael's is a Purina product.  While not trying to malign Purina, I am not aware of any better quality dog foods they produce.<br /><br />The ingredients, in order, directly from the label:<br />Beef, soybean meal, soy flour, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice, soy protein concentrate, corn gluten meal, ground yellow corn, glycerin, poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, salt, grilled sirloin steak flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, sulfur, Vitamin E supplement, choline chloride, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6), niacin, wheat flour, potassium chloride, L-Lysine monohydrochloride, manganese sulfate, Vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, copper sulfate, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin B-12 supplement, pyridoxine hydrochloride, garlic oil, Vitamin D-3 supplement, folic acid, calcium iodate, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), biotin, sodium selenite. C-5900.<br /><br />Nothing against beef for my dog, so it doesn't start out bad.  But after that....soybean meal and soy flour are just \"protein fillers\".  The next largest ingredient is animal fat.  Animal fat can come from numerous sources, including rodents, diseased animals, and you really just don't know the source.  After that, there are several grains, many of which do not provide any nutritional value for a dog, like corn. This dog food also contains poultry by-products.  Any by-product is typically bad:  it can be various parts of animals, heads, feet, beaks. Some people point to its protein concentration, but in general meat and poultry by-products should be avoided.<br /><br />There is also artificial coloring in the food.  Not that there is necessarily anything horrible with this, but it is dog food, so why add something which has no value and could potentially be harmful to the dog?<br /><br />So what is there to like about this product?  As a dog food, really not much.  But, dogs do seem to like the taste, so, like junk food for humans, maybe a little bit in moderation can be used as a treat.  The food consistency is \"chewy\" so I squeeze together a couple of pieces and give it to my dog as a \"candy\" treat.<br /><br />Sadly, the price of this dog food is not so low as to make it such a value by weight as to draw people to buy it.  For this 4.5 pound bag, for the same price per ounce, you can buy a much better dog food. Even when buying a larger bag of this product, it is not that much less per ounce than better quality dog food.  When you factor in that it's got a lot of low quality ingredients, it is not a better bargain at all.",

With that being said... My dog liked this Purina dog food, by Chef Michael's, just fine. He finished the bag off completely, without discrimination. Honestly, he does this with just about any quality of food. I guess I got lucky that way. It is unfortunate that my dog does know what it's like to be hungry, thus he is less likely to be finicky.<br /><br />I do believe in healthy foods for my pet and not so much those filler ingredients. However, these foods can be supplemented in his diet by adding veggies and whole meats to any brand of dog food that is not fortified or primaried with such, and Purina is no exception.<br /><br />In addition to their bagged dog food, I like to give my dog a hearty beef rib once a week. This only costs an additional $10.00 for a rack of 8-12 hearty ribs. Not to shabby for a 2-3 month supply.<br /><br />As a consumer, I rely mostly on the marketing of what is in the packages ingredients list and trusting that Purina is using the ingredients of the highest quality in this and all of their products. And when they list beef as the first ingredient, that it is the primary ingredient and not made with the least amount. And down the near future, I do not hear about a recall on this pet food because it was tainted with... who knows what.<br /><br />As far as the dog food goes, it was liked by my pet and he did seem to enjoy it, that's what matters most.

But the dogs don't know what's good for them, and they don't know when to stop.  Our dogs have been on rationed food in order to keep them trim and fit.  One of them, a labradoodle, scarfs up the food so fast that she has to have her small portions doled out to her in smaller portions.

This made it even worse.<br /><br />As others have said, it's like candy for dogs compared to the other foods out there.

For a regular diet, I just don't see the content this offers as matching up to some of the better designed foods out there for pets.

It is extremely soy and corn heavy (both almost guaranteed to be GM), and includes nasty items like poultry by-product meal and animal digest. Whatever those chunks are, they are in no way related to real meat.<br /><br />As much as my dog loved this, I will not be making it part of his regular diet - it's just not real food.",

    "review_text": "I can start out by saying that my two dogs both love this food, and by their reaction, I could say it's their favorite.  There are things I like about it too.  It smells decent, and has a texture unlike any other food we've ever tried.  It is a bit softer and easier on my older dog's teeth and gums.  Most importantly, my dogs have absolutely no digestive problems after eating this, unlike some other brands we have used.  The ingredient list on the package, however. indicates it is more in line with other supermarket brands, but so does the price.  I would love to say I only buy the most premium products, but realistically I want a food my dogs like, that makes them feel good and has adequate nutrients, and this fits the bill.  I feed my dogs real meat on occasion, and buy the premium brands when I can get a sale, but I feel comfortable that this dog food is fine for most of my dog's needs.",

    "review_text": "I have a 12-year-old finicky beyond belief Shih-tzu and for the first time in her life I have found a dry food that she really likes. Well, she really likes the chewy meat shaped pieces. The crunchy green and yellowish kibble-like bits were not as appealing to her. In fact, I found myself picking up those pieces off the carpet because she takes a big mouthful from the bowl, then spits it all out and selects the pieces she wants to eat. The remainder is left on the floor for me to clean up.<br /><br />That said, in 4 out of 5 days of feeding, Lily has chosen the Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin Dry Dog Food over her favorite wet, canned food. I have been searching for years for a dry food that she would eat. You have no idea how many bags of food I've dropped off at the local animal shelter because Lily turns her nose up at everything...especially dry dog food. It looks like Chef Michael has cooked up a winner. This will be our go-to dog food from here on out. Or until Lily decides she doesn't like it anymore.",

    "review_text": "I concur with the majority of the reviews here: my dog seems to quite like this food. It feels a bit moist, looks somewhat colorful, and even smells a bit of beef. In other words, it certainly comes across as good-quality dog food. However, it's worth noting that the ingredients seem to be somewhat of a mixed bag.<br /><br />Beef is the most prevalent ingredient, which indicates a slightly higher quality of product. Look at the labels of many other bags of dog food, and you'll see that the first ingredient is usually some filler -- unfortunately, fillers seem to take up several of the succeeding slots on the ingredients list of this Chef Michael's product. So it's certainly not the highest quality you'll find, but it's definitely not the worst either.<br /><br />Bottom line, my guess is that it seems to be a bit higher quality than your average bag of dog food, and that makes it a bargain for the price. You could do better if you're willing to pay for it, but I think this food will do well for most dog owners.",

Her normal dog food is Iam's Healthy Naturals with wholesome chicken.<br />When I first put this in her bowl, she scarfed down those red dye-colored beef pieces first.

A bag of Iam's this size would cost only  $7.29.<br />I don't like soy nor do I like gluten which this contains and it also has added dyes.  Iam's has no artificial preservatives and has enough vitamins and minerals to actually list them in the Guaranteed Analysis list.  I feel the vitamins and minerals are important.  Chef's Michael's says it has 23 essential vitamins and minerals in there somewhere but not enough to list, I guess.<br />Chef Michael's contains green beans and potatoes and Iam's has tomatoes, peas, brewer's yeast, flax meal, dried apple pomace and spinach and whole grain sorghum and barley, although I don't like grains either.  How many dogs have you seen out chewing on wheat or barley in a field...lol<br /><br />So much to my dog's chagrin, I'll not be buying this dog food in the future.",

    "review_title": "Very Popular Chow, but Spendy",
    "review_text": "I've seen the commercials for this stuff, and they really got my attention for their sheer lack of any similarity between what they portray and me and my dog.  I don't wear modestly tight v-neck cardigans in lovely pastels with the sleeves pushed up just-so with a new crisp white t-shirt.  I don't live by myself in a stunningly designed and ridiculously immaculate apartment.  And my dog is a 105-pound golden retriever, not some yapping little toy breed that I can hold in the crook of my toned and oh so delicately furred (and tan) arm.  So is this product for that guy, or for me?<br /><br />Let's be honest here, the way this dog food looks (and is titled) has nothing to do with the dog.  This is all about creating impressions with the animal carrying the wallet.  It's clear I'm supposed to be seeing some kind of marvelous stew, a wonderful stroganoff, with glistening chunks of the choicest beef (the package calls them \"tender pieces\"), with delicious vegetable bits (\"crunchy kibbles\") thrown in for my own precious nutrition.  The bag photo even has it laid out delightfully on a wooden cutting board--I can't remember the last time I fed my dog from one of my cutting boards.  If my mouth goes all Pavlov looking at this product and remembering that for some reason they're calling it \"grilled sirloin,\" then of course I'll want to feed it to my dog.<br /><br />So how did it taste?  Well, a taste test between Duncan's regular Kibbles and Bits and this product was somewhat inconclusive.  Chef Michael's tender pieces are definitely squishier.  They're not necessarily more moist, although I believe this is what you're supposed to think of this product.  The beef-like tender pieces were springy, kind of like beef jerky left out overnight so it's partially re-hydrated.  They tasted a little funky to me, almost like they were going bad, with a very subtle fishiness.  That may sound bad, but remember that dogs are omnivores and carrion-eaters.  The crunchy kibbles were completely indistinguishable from any other dry dog food I've ever had (yes, I was a fraternity pledge once).  The kibbles are crunchy enough, but not like breakfast cereal, not like a saltine, not like peanut brittle.  More like well-done-meat crunchy, except this is factory-pressed meal.<br /><br />The tender pieces look to me, well, like shredded scat.  Color and shape, that's it.  That's harsh, yes, but it's the truth.  I would think that since they are calling the product \"grilled sirloin,\" then the tender pieces might have some kind of faux grill marks, but no.  The crunchy kibbles look like fake peas and little brown dog food bits, just like all the other dry dog foods.<br /><br />And what did Duncan think?  Well, he literally just inhaled this stuff.  As soon as the bag was opened he caught a whiff of it, knew it to be his kind of food, and went right for it, face into the bag with no hesitation.  The first couple of handfuls on the floor were gone in seconds, and for the seven meals he had of this stuff, it was gone in minutes.  No doubt about it, he really likes this stuff (I don't know if he's seen the commercials).  Maybe this is a function of it being something completely new to him, or this literally could be dog food orgasm chow, for all I know.<br /><br />It's important to note that within an hour of eating this, Duncan brought forth in the family room an extended, sonorous flatus the likes of which we could not recall.  Eye-wateringly powerful.  You've been warned.<br /><br />And it's expensive, which is the single reason I won't be buying more.  Having a big dog, we're going through a lot of food, usually buying the 40- or 50-pound bag.  Based on the current price for the 11-pound bag, that would be well over $80 a bag.  Sorry, but although my dog clearly digs on this chow, that price is prohibitive.<br /><br />Bottom line: Didn't taste special to me, but the dog sure did like it, and that's a plus. But it's just too expensive for a big dog.",

The food is colorful (for the human appeal) with crunchy kibbles as well as tender pieces.  I prefer to feed our dogs crunchy kibbles if they are able to eat it, because I think it keeps their teeth cleaner.  There seemed to be more large tender pieces than crunchy, but the dogs loved it all.  The food size was fine for both the large dog and the small dog.  The large dog transitioned from her regular food to Chef's with no trouble.  The smaller dog had some digestive issues for a few days (very soft stools) until that cleared up and she was fine.  The bag claims \"23 essential vitamins & minerals\" and a \"well rounded meal for adult dogs\".<br /><br />One nice packaging plus was the bag shows the actual size pieces of food, something helpful to me with 2 different sized dogs.

Fiona, on the other hand, is a bit of a princess, especially when it comes to her kibble. She usually gets excited then sits around and waits for her brother to finish so she can tease him.

    "review_text": "We recently changed our dog's normal food because she has gotten picky and no longer wants to eat the premium brand we've bought for several years.  We've tried several types thus far and she likes them all (who says dogs don't need variety in their food?).  Since the Chef Michael's was offered as part of the Amazon Vine program, I decided to give it a try.  The first day of trying Chef Michael's, as soon as I mixed it with her current food, she gobbled the whole bowl.  That's different for her.  She usually leaves some of her food so she can eat throughout the day.  As time has gone by, I've noticed she will dig through the bowl of mixed food and pick out the Chef Michael's pieces, eat them first and then nibble on the other brand in the bowl.  If she leaves any food in the bowl to come back and eat later in the day, it's always the other food, not Chef Michael's.<br /><br />Yes, the Chef Michael's food is expensive but it's not out of line with other the other premium dog foods we've been buying at the pet store.  As a matter of fact, it's considerably lower priced than some of them.  So price is not really a big factor in buying this dog food if you've been buying premium brands all along.<br /><br />The ingredients are consideration, however.  Some of the ingredients in the Chef Michael's is not exactly on the politically correct list for healthy eating.  For that reason, we will probably continue to follow our current procedure of mixing a little of the Chef Michael's with a larger quantity of another type of premium and better nutritionally balanced food.  Our pooch loves it and adding a little pizzazz to her meals brightens up her day.  That's worth a lot.<br /><br />If this review was based on nutritional value alone, I would probably give it 3 stars.  It's not really bad as far as nutrition is concerned but it's not as good as other foods within the same price range.  But I bow to the family dog whose opinion is paramount.",

I could definitely tell she liked the new food since she seemed to be picking it out of her old food.  She has been eating the Costco brand salmon grain free food for years so this was a huge change for her since the second and third ingredient was some type of soy product.  However the most disturbing part is the oil.  I didn't realize it until after several pieces of kibble laid in my pantry for several days until I vacuumed it up and there were oil stains on my slate flooring.  Let me just say the Costco kibble doesn't do that.  We'll be sticking with the old brand of dog food for now, but my dog has appreciated a little variety in her diet the last few weeks.",

    "review_text": "This is far from the worst dog food on the shelf. However, MUCH better foods are available for MUCH less money.<br /><br />If you know anything about canine nutrition, or care enough about your pet to want to feed them something that's good for them, you probably won't pick this food. Yes, it's better than Wallyworld's Old Roy (which fails my two tests below much worse than this does), but it's far from great. Here's why:<br /><br />Like all other crappy dog foods (95% of what's on the shelf at the store), this food includes corn. Dogs do not digest corn well. It makes for terrible dog food. The only good thing about this food is that beef is the first ingredient. After that, it goes downhill fast. There isn't another good ingredient until you get to dried green beans, and there's practically none in the bag (calcium phosphate and salt both come before the green beans). And that's the only other decent ingredient in the whole bag.<br /><br />Here are my own personal rules for selecting a good dog food:<br /><br />1. If the word \"corn\" appears ANYWHERE in the ingredients, I pass. It's not good for the dog. Other grains are more okay: rice (preferably brown, not brewers), etc. A few non-corn grains are fine, but you don't want your pet eating mostly grains. While omnivorous (most fruits and veggies are great), dogs are Carnivores.<br /><br />2. Meat must be high on the ingredients list, preferably in the #1 position (\"meal\" is okay; just means dried meat. \"By-products\" are not okay: that means ground up bones and toenails). This food does okay based on this one metric. Doesn't make it great though.<br /><br />Those two rules pretty much guarantee you'll weed out the junk. And yes, Science Diet is junk, despite what your vet told you.<br /><br />3. My $ rule: $1 a pound or less, because I'm frugal. This is about the price point where great dog foods are obtainable (that doesn't mean all expensive dog foods are good; in fact, all of the big brands (purina, iams, pedigree, eukanuba, science diet, etc) are all well-marketed, overpriced junk). The only major exception to the \"good food usually costs more\" rule that I've noticed is Costco's dog food, which is actually pretty good, and only about 25 bucks for a 40 pound bag. Best deal in canine nutrition, I think.<br /><br />This food is incredibly expensive, over two bucks a pound. You can do a lot better. For that price, you can get any of the highest quality dog foods available locally.<br /><br />Where'd I get my info? A lot of research. Start with a google search for the Whole Dog Journal's annual review of dog foods. It's the most authoritative thing out there.  Additionally, my wife is a dog trainer (the Best Friends type, not the Cesar Milan type; corn is to dog food what the \"dog whisperer\" is to dog training: junk) and works at our local humane society, where they get to test a LOT of donated foods.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and I teach the Mammalogy course at our local university. I understand mammalian anatomy and digestion.<br /><br />If you care about your pet, do your homework, people. And please don't use the \"but my dog likes this brand\" test. I love ice cream, and would eat it at every meal if I could, but my wife tells me it's not good for me. Cheap dog foods are loaded with grease to make dogs want it. Doesn't make it healthy.",

Large amounts of soy give my dog (just a year old) horrendous gas.  I actually didn't read the label before I fed it to him which was completely my fault.

In addition, this contains ground wheat, and I've learned from past experience that wheat contributes to arthritic symptoms in some dogs.  I also don't like the \"grilled steak flavor\" which is obviously artificial flavoring and has nothing to do with meat.  That's how they can get away with saying this dog food has \"grilled sirloin steak flavor.\"<br /><br />I am sorry to give a poor review.  I hate giving bad reviews.

That said, we stopped giving our dogs Greenies for a period of time and there was a significant amount of brown-colored build up around the base of our dogs' teeth.  We started giving them Greenies again and within a short period of time the build-up was gone in most areas and, overall, greatly reduced.  I realize that we could brush our dogs teeth in order to avoid the cost, but neither of us wants to take on this chore; plus, the dogs LOVE Greenies.<br /><br />I used to buy this product at Petsmart, but they're much less expensive on Amazon.",

I highly recommend these treats for your dog if you want him to have good teeth and breath. We've never had trouble with him being able to digest them.

I noticed she was getting diarrhea didnt really think it was the greenies until I did research and found alot of dogs have digestive issues over this stuff and some small dogs have even died. My dog is 60lbs not small but it was affecting her stomach. I stopped for a week and her stool was back to normal. The other day I gave her one greenie to see how she would react and 12hrs later the diarrhea is back. She had it all day yesterday and some this morning, hopefully tomorrow it is all gone but these greenies are now in the garbage and I am in search of other dental chews.",

In particular, ones about dogs vomitting green sponges after eating them.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I have a little maltese (Dexter). He's a little over two years old and loves greenies. Absolutely loves them. They're his favorite treat. He loves to hide them and then go back for them later.<br /><br />A couple things to watch for... the package says to only feed them one a day. We were feeding him like 3 or 4 a day. We thought it was like a dental treat and couldn't hurt. We've cut it back to one a day and every once and awhile we'll give him two.<br /><br />Another thing, they can be messy. When we first got him and he was tiny, it would take him awhile to eat them. Once they get wet, they tend to stick to things. Now that he's older, he eats them pretty fast so there's no problem.<br /><br />We've never had him vomit from them, ever. Even when we were giving him 4 a day. He loves them and has never gotten ill from them. One time, he got into the package when we weren't paying attention and hid them all over the house so he probably has a secret stash somewhere.<br /><br />I would stick to the product recommendations (if you can) and if your dog is like ours, he'll love them.",

I Ended Up Getting 2 Boxes For The Same Price That I Would Have Paid For 1 Box At The Pet Store.<br />The Package Arrived Very Quickly & We Even Recieved A Free Sample Size Bag Of Dog Food, Which Was An Unexpected Bonus. The Only Issue I Had Was I Feel They Could Have Put Everything In A Smaller Shipping Box. Other Then That We Are Extremely Satisfied & So Is Our Sweet Little Pom. Thank You Amazon!",

Absolutely loves them. They're his favorite treat. He loves to hide them and then go back for them later.<br /><br />A couple things to watch for... the package says to only feed them one a day. We were feeding him like 3 or 4 a day. We thought it was like a dental treat and couldn't hurt. We've cut it back to one a day and every once and awhile we'll give him two.<br /><br />Another thing, they can be messy. When we first got him and he was tiny, it would take him awhile to eat them. Once they get wet, they tend to stick to things. Now that he's older, he eats them pretty fast so there's no problem.<br /><br />We've never had him vomit from them, ever. Even when we were giving him 4 a day. He loves them and has never gotten ill from them. One time, he got into the package when we weren't paying attention and hid them all over the house so he probably has a secret stash somewhere.<br /><br />I would stick to the product recommendations (if you can) and if your dog is like ours, he'll love them.",

I tried gifting them to another small dog owner, only to find they are warned against as a choking hazard. Turns out they are so gummy that they sometimes get stuck in a dog's throat and choke the poor thing to death. Maybe my dog knew something I didn't... or maybe they just don't taste or smell that good to some dogs. Buyer beware. (Message me if you want an almost full 96 count box for just the cost of shipping, since if you are going to buy them, I hate to throw away something someone else can use.)",

Absolutely loves them. They're his favorite treat. He loves to hide them and then go back for them later.<br /><br />A couple things to watch for... the package says to only feed them one a day. We were feeding him like 3 or 4 a day. We thought it was like a dental treat and couldn't hurt. We've cut it back to one a day and every once and awhile we'll give him two.<br /><br />Another thing, they can be messy. When we first got him and he was tiny, it would take him awhile to eat them. Once they get wet, they tend to stick to things. Now that he's older, he eats them pretty fast so there's no problem.<br /><br />We've never had him vomit from them, ever. Even when we were giving him 4 a day. He loves them and has never gotten ill from them. One time, he got into the package when we weren't paying attention and hid them all over the house so he probably has a secret stash somewhere.<br /><br />I would stick to the product recommendations (if you can) and if your dog is like ours, he'll love them.",

    "review_text": "Dan's Perfect Popcorn<br /><br />Note:  This is a very thorough recipe, but it is very important you follow these steps closely.<br /><br />Heat 2 TBS of vegetable oil in a medium sized pot for 5 minutes on high.<br /><br />Pour in 1/2 cup of popcorn kernels and leave uncovered.  As soon as the first kernel pops, put the lid on crooked to let the steam escape.<br /><br />Note: If your popcorn rises too high and is close to touching the bottom of the lid (use a clear lid) then remove the lid. Do not let the popcorn touch the moisture that accumulates on the bottom of the lid. It will ruin all those pieces.<br /><br />When finished popping (about 1 second in between pops), pour popcorn into a large bowl and place the empty pot back on the burner (now turned off).<br /><br />Add 1 TBS of unsalted butter (cut into small squares) into the pot you just cooked your popcorn in. Hold the pot and angle it so that the butter just stays on one side of the pot. If there are any remaining bits of popcorn in the pot, use your butter knife to knock them down into the melted butter. These are great little nuggets of joy while eating the popcorn!<br /><br />Slowly pour half of the butter over the popcorn in a circular fashion, starting at the center and working your way outward to the edge of the bowl. You want to pour a little more butter around the center and less around the edges, since the center of the bowl is the deepest. Sprinkle salt (1/2 the amount you would use) over the top. Use your butter knife and your opposite hand together to lightly toss the popcorn.<br /><br />Note: It is important to salt your popcorn after you pour the butter and before tossing, because the salt will stick better to the popcorn.<br /><br />Pour the other half of the melted butter over the popcorn. Sprinkle the other half of salt over your popcorn.  Lightly toss again.  Taste it.  Add salt if necessary.  Eat right away.<br /><br />Note: If you like your popcorn more buttery and/or oily, add 1/2 to 1 TBS of each to the recipe.",

    "review_text": "We have a trolley style popcorn maker and used popcorn oil and popcorn bought at the grocery store at first. We had many unpopped kernels and the taste was only okay.<br /><br />Then I ordered a case of Great Northern Popcorn 8-Ounce Portion Packs. This popcorn is great! We love the taste even three days after popping on the occasion when it lasts that long. We just followed the instructions on the package and all is well.<br /><br />I was a little concerned when I first noticed the oil was in a soft, but solid state. It melts quickly though. The only complaint I have is that it is a little difficult to pour it all in at once, but this is due to the layout of my popcorn popper.<br /><br />We have had friends over for football parties and they have requested more popcorn.",

    "review_title": "Salty tip",
    "review_text": "The saltiness depends on how you prepare it.  When you pour the salt in with the oil and kernels and then pop the corn you can use the whole salt thing and it won't be salty at all.  If you only cook the kernels in the oil without the salt and then sprinkle the salt on to the popped corn last, it will be immensely salty. (I prefer the immensely salty style).  I really like this popcorn, I make it in a whirly-pop.  It always comes out perfect every time.  I like to add even more buttery-oil-goodness after popping (I like Kernel Seasons popcorn oil) to make it just like movie theater style.  This popcorn is a million times better than prepackaged microwave popcorn, the two are not even in the same league.",

    "review_text": "When I read about Great Northern Popcorn packs, I was skeptical.  I thought it was just another gimmick to get me to buy everything prepackaged at a premium price.  After all, popcorn is all the same, right?  My wife insisted that we try it and I am glad we did.  If you love movie theater popcorn, this will be the closest you will get to making it at home.  I tried others and they just do not compare.  I am not sure if it is the type of oil they use, the type of salt, or the popcorn itself, but this popcorn is second to none.  Also, everything is conveniently measured out for you, so this makes the task of making popcorn so much simpler.  If you try it, you may be surprised how much more popcorn you start to eat!",

    "review_text": "Not sure if this is the fault of the popcorn, the popcorn popper or the user, but I'm having a problem with unpopped kernels. I follow the instructions precisely and have tried just about everything but haven't cracked the code yet. Those kernels that do pop are tasty, but it seems like I lose 25 to 30 percent of kernels which don't pop.<br /><br />The other thing to notice, the coconut oil sort of congeals at room temperature, so I found it helpful to warm it up so it's nice an runny before putting it in my popper. Usually I just put the packet between my hand and leg for a few minutes to warm it up. Not a major problem, just something to be aware of.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't do the subscription. I think I may try another brand to see if it makes any difference.<br /><br />BTW, one 8 oz package makes enough to fill three of the bags that come with the machine with a little left over. So for my family of 5, one 8 oz package isn't really enough, but two is too much.",

More of the kernels popped, they were far fluffier, and the popcorn simply tasted better (this is after salting the West Bend with Paragon Butter Flavored Seasoning Salt). The packs make it very simple. Cut the top, dump in the kettle, hit the heater, wait for the sound of the sizzle, and go! My only concern is that you have to take a bit of care not to drop oil all over the place. If you cut the top off, then carefully 'roll' the pack, it makes it much easier to drop it all in, then squeeze the oil out.",

And definitely doesn't have the movie theater taste or texture. Also, if you put all the seasoning salt in with the corn & oil, a lot of it sticks to the machine, so I leave a little to sprinkle on afterwards to help with the flavor. I'm thinking maybe I'll try not using all the corn, next time and see if that is a better corn-to-oil ratio. I might also try just using a big pot too and see if that's any better than the Stir Crazy.<br /><br />** EDIT ** July 2011 ** so, after popping quite a few bags in different ways, I can say now that if you use a regular kettle, with only 1/2 the salt, it tastes great. I think it's because only about 2/3 of it pops - so this allows for more oil/flavor per kernel.",

It is edible; although extremely salty. Tastes nothing like carnival style popcorn, severely lacking in butter flavor. The only positive aspect of this product is the convenience in the pack itself.

You can cook it on the stove in a big tall pot like you would use for sweet corn. My only suggestion is not to put the lid on the pot but to put a mesh splatter screen over it. This will permit the vapor to escape keeping the popcorn light and fluffy and not moist.<br />This popcorn is so good you don't need to add butter either. It's fine just the way it is which is better for our health too. I have two family members that have bought Princeton machines and this popcorn because they liked ours so much, and any time friends come over for a movie or just to visit, they always ask if I would make popcorn.<br />The 8 oz. cases shipped free through Amazon really don't cost any more per oz. than you'd pay for Orville microwave in a grocery store and is hundered fold better. Ever eat left-over microwave popcorn the next day?....Yuk, it's disgusting. And you're not suppose to breath the vapor when you first open the bag fresh out of the microwave, and you want to eat that stuff? Great Northern still tastes fresh and good for days if you bag it up. After your first bag of Great Northern you'll wonder why on Earth you ever keep eating that junk from the grocery store.",

I do add just 1/2 of the salt while popping and the remaining salt I have placed in a shaker for those that like more.  If you are looking for that \"MOVIE\" butter flavor this is the one!",

Everyone who comes over for movie night says it is the best popcorn they have ever had.  We tried some other kinds, but now just buy this popcorn.  It is easy to make since everything is included in one bag.  Just cut off the top and dump in.  I highly recommend this popcorn",

Food is not allowed to be returned to Amazon so I am stuck with over 20 bags of corn kernels that are inedible. Followed the directions exactly and popped the corn in my new popper, making sure not to over cook. Popcorn came out stale tasting with card board consistency. It was dry and just awful.

    "review_title": "Saturated Fat Nightmare",
    "review_text": "With all the reviews of this popcorn, I'm surprised not to find any mention of the horrible saturated fat content of this. Anyone with any concern about their cholesterol or saturated fat content really needs to look closely at the nutritional guide. I couldn't find it listed on their website so I asked them to email me a copy. Wow, 40g of saturated fats in one of these packets and they call it 5 servings. Daily limit of saturated fats for a 2,000 calorie/day person is 16. You would have to eat 4 big macs to match the saturated content of this popcorn. The biggest concern I have with this is the company told me it has no plans to even offer a healthful alternative for pre-packaged packets like this. The problem is entirely with the oil they are using. Coconut oil. They list on their packet no cholesterol and no trans fats, but there's conveniently no mention of the overwhelming amount of saturated fats due to the coconut oil. Most movie theaters have finally changed from coconut oil to canola or other good oils to address this major health concern and bad press over the years. I asked Great Northern to please follow suit, not even asking them to replace this oil with the good oils but to just offer an alternative. They refused. It tastes just as good to me at the movie theaters. In some cases the saturated fats have been reduced 15 times with the change from coconut to good oils. I love popcorn. But health is a concern to me. If you are concerned about saturated fats, look at the nutritional guide for these packets.",

Now, the popcorn is just the way I like it and I added just a bit of butter. Try it first and then see if the salt/seasoning is too much for you - it was very easy to remove. I found that the 2.5 size was perfect for one, maybe two people, but truthfully, I can eat all of it by myself while watching a movie.",

Makes a lot of popcorn, plenty for two or three people, and has a good taste, comes packed in a handy packets and just cut small corners out to pour the oil and popcorn into a measuring cup to put into the kettle.

It tastes just like the kind you get at the movie theater or a carnival and the smell is just fantastic.  When using my WhirleyPop I usually only get about 10-12 unpopped kernels.  The more comfortable I get using the popper I'm sure that number will decrease.  The corn pops up nice and crispy without any greasiness (as sometimes movie theater popcorn can be).<br /><br />However, I do think that the popcorn is a bit too salty (thus giving it 4 stars instead of 5) for my family's taste so I use only 1/2 - 3/4 of the seasoning versus using the entire packet.<br /><br />I think I got a great deal being that I recieved the popcorn, oil, and seasoning all for $39.99 and free shipping.  It couldn't be easier because all I do is dump it all in the popper and 'turn the crank!<br /><br />A minor complaint I do have, and I'm wondering if this has happened to anyone else, is that a few of the packets do leak a little bit; nothing major but enough to notice.  I will continue to purchase this brand because of the great taste and ease of use!<br /><br />UPDATE***In retrospect $39.99 wasn't that great of a deal being that now, the price has gone down by $10+!  :o)  I have been using my popper with this popcorn for quite some time now and rarely get any more than 5-10 unpopped kernels.  I have tried other brands as well, buying bulk popcorn kernels with Orvil Reddenbocker's popcorn oil and they do not even compare.  I did it to try and save a bit more money and not only did my popcorn not come out to my liking, it was quite a pain measuring the ingredients.  I will be sticking to Great American!",

After the Great Northern popcorn arrived, I was immediately hooked on the flavor and ease of use.  The packages are easy to use and the product tastes great.

    "review_text": "I have been using this coconut oil for the past few days and I am happy with the results.  I first tried it on its own and the consistency was not too appealing to me, so I began putting it in my meals and that works better for me.  I have also used a portion of it with some Shea Butter as a moisturizer and it works great as well.  It seems to me the uses are endless.  I can see that I will be purchasing another container of this because it is so versatile and all natural.  I really love that and I love this coconut oil.  It does have a slight coconut taste and smell.  I get a hint of it when i cook with it but it is does not over power any of the dishes that I make with it.  Also it absorbs very quickly into the skin leaving it soft but not greasy and there is slight coconut smell but it fades quickly once absorb into the skin.  It is a bit pricey and is definitely an investment.  The serving size of 1 tablespoon 3-4 times a day is a bit much and will contribute to the necessity of purchasing another jar quicker than I would like.  Overall, very happy with my purchase.  As always thanks Amazon for such a wide and wonderful selection of products.",

Don't like the results on your hair? Try it on that dry patch of skin you have. Not healing it quick enough? Put it on a piece of toast. Coconut flavor too strong? Bake with it as a substitute for other butters/oils in recipes. And statistically, how can one person not be happy with at least one of these options that coconut oil offers? Honestly, this is the smartest purchase I have ever made, I will never go back to putting butter on toast, the coconut flavor is absolutely delicious. The texture is much lighter and it just smells so.amazingly.GOOD. I love how the subtle taste infused into my sunny side up egg, and although I haven't tried it in other foods yet, I'm REALLY looking forward to doing so IMMEDIATELY!!",

I recently went to an over-priced \"Parisian\" hair salon to get a keratin treatment and it left my long, natural hair severely damaged, breaking, and feeling like straw. Yes, I am still miffed. My sister insisted that I ditch all the expensive treatments and commercial products and just let my hair go natural and treat it with coconut oil which she uses on her gorgeous, long, black tresses. In desperation, I ordered several bottles. They came surprisingly fast and I immediately tore open the box and after inhaling the euphoric aroma for a half a minute, I slathered it on my hair and scalp and left it on all day (while indoors). After I washed it off, my hair was visibly silkier, shinier, and had much less breakage. I'm in love! Also, I use it on my skin and it absorbs well and leaves my skin supple with a slight smell of coconut. Love the price, love the product. Can't go wrong.",

(I give all of this detail in case someone is making the decision for themselves as identifies with my hair profile.)<br /><br />My Hubby is a hairdresser / salon owner and because of this I get to try all kinds of hair products.  I've even had expensive caviar shampoo and conditioner (As I roll my eyes). I've used other oils in my hair and most require several washings to get the oil out.  Not this Coconut Oil.  I put it on my dry hair at night and wrap a satin wrapping cap around it while I sleep.  (available near the relaxer s in the hair care section of the store) When I wake I shampoo an condition like normal and my hair looks amazing! I use it twice a week now!<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />Nothing and I mean nothing has made my hair feel as silky and look as shiny as this Coconut Oil.<br /><br />The oil starts out think like crisco but melts in your hands when rubbed together quickly.  This consistency makes it super easy to apply.<br /><br />It isn't runny or drippy.<br /><br />Amazingly \"repairs\" hair after too much sun, surf, chlorine etc.<br /><br />When washed it does not leave a fragrance behind.<br /><br />No Chemicals! 100% Organic and good for you!<br /><br />THE TRICKY<br /><br />It smell of the coconut is rich and luscious and I love it -  but it was hard to ignore it when I woke up or turned over in the night.

I have tried various so-called virgin coconut oils before, but they smelled so rancid within one week of opening, that at one point I resorted to rendering my own coconut oil, but that was so time-consuming and tedious. Some other brands were masked by additional scent. For a while I was discouraged from trying any coconut oil, until I read reviews on this one. I tried one, and I was hooked. It smelled so HEAVENLY like the fresh coconut that I remember. Every time I would apply on my skin or hair, I would be reminded of our rice-based coconut desserts, so for purposes of having a dose of 1-2 tbsp per day, it was also not hard for me to take it plain, although the lack of sweetness quickly brings me back to the reality that it was not coconut-y dessert I was eating, but that's easily solved by adding muscovado or brown sugar. This is certainly the best coconut oil I have had so far, and the ONLY one I have tried and actually finished (I used to stop using those previous ones when I could no longer stomach the rancid smell, which usually brought the content down to only 25%).  This is also the first coconut oil brand that I actually tried to bake with (although it quickly used up my tub). I have subscribed for this to be delivered monthly, but I might change that to a more frequent supply of fresh tubs. After I was truly impressed by it, only then did I check out where it came from, and was surprised to find that it came from my country! Keep up the good work of making available a quality product to the whole world!",

Antibiotics, skin creams, food changes, special shampoos, ugh you name it, I've put more money onto my dogs rear end then I have ever spent on myself, and to top it off all his skin issues make him smelly! I read online that coconut oil helps solve a multitude of issues inside and out, and since it's something all natural, I feel better about using it in general.<br /><br />I put it directly onto his legs and lower back just today, the fragrant coconut oil really helps with cutting back on how smelly he is, He seems less restless with his itchy spots - but only time will really tell if this stuff is really going to make any progress for him.<br /><br />The other reason I purchased this was because I wanted to make my own handmade soap, and it worked just fine for that use!",

    "review_text": "Received my Coconut Oil yesterday, opened immediately for a taste.<br /><br />1. Pulled off the safety seal and the aroma of fresh coconut wafted out-very pleasant<br /><br />2. Took a teeny, tiny bit of the \"oil\" (it's a solid) for a taste. With the aroma, your mind sets you up for MOUNDS...it is NOT.  It's very subtle and not at all sweet and it melts on your tongue faster than butter.<br /><br />3. I toasted a waffle to give it a real test---Most excellent, a hint of coconut and I added a dab of berry preserves....very good.  I have a friend who sautees shrimp in it and serves with a mango salsa---now doesn't that sound GOOD!<br /><br />4. I proceeded to put a small dab on the back of one hand and I do mean SMALL---VERY small...rubbed the BACKS of my hands together to liquify and then distributed over my hands and lower arms.  The dab was so small it was almost not \"there\".  My hands were so smooth it was amazing.<br /><br />More testing to begin on the long term benefits - right now - very happy<br /><br />** Update - one of the major reasons for purchasing this product are the multitude of health benefits for consuming coconut oil---I just discovered one that is ADDICTIVE.<br />Keebler makes a new wheatable NutCrisp small cracker: Crunchy Cashew...a little dollop on a cracker and it is absolutely heaven---you can easily get your 3 (recommended) tablespoons a day",

From the outside, it looked like the oil had separated and that some had settled in the bottom. When I stuck a spoon in, I found it was hardened/had solidified on the bottom. I was able to break it up into smaller chunks, but it wouldn't dissolve. The oil I was able to get out of it worked, but I'm disappointed with the quality of the one I received.

Make sure to put it on last as a sealant for any other moisturizers that you use. I feel a lot better knowing that something I am putting onto my skin and absorbing into my bloodstream does not contain a mass of impossible to pronounce ingredients. My only advice is that you find some kind of bottle to put it in or mix it into your favorite lotion. I rinsed out an empty shampoo bottle.

Since it was summer and quite hot, the coconut oil arrived in its water-like state. Whoever packed them put them on their sides and consequently, several of them which were also not adequately sealed, leaked and soaked the box they came in. Amazon replaced the 3 leaky ones. Unfortunately, the same guy must have packaged them. He (she) put them in upside down. All 3 leaked.<br /><br />On the brighter side, I bought it because a doctor on line said it help cure her husband of Alzheimer's. I've been giving it to my husband who suffers from a different type of dementia.

    "review_text": "I originally purchased this item because my mom has been using Coconut Oil for years and her skin is always so soft, smooth and flawless.  She told me she uses it on her hair and it worked wonders.  So after researching it's benefits on the internet I decided to purchase some.  This brand had the best reviews.  I used it as a leave in conditioner on my transistioning hair (I'm afro american) and it gave me a new head of soft hair!  My hair was damaged from dying my hair after a relaxer and it started breaking and shedding extremly bad.  After using the coconut oil one time my hair is moisturized all the way to my ends, no shedding, shiny, non greasy, and just plain beautiful.  I've also decided to use it in cooking too.  I HIGHLY recommend trying some, you won't regret it!! And it tastes and smells wonderful!!",

    "review_text": "I was looking for natural moisturizers that alleviate symptoms of eczema and I came across this coconut oil.  My baby is 5 months old and after 24 hours of applying this oil from head to toe, his red patches were significantly reduced.  My whole family was amazed at the results.  No, it is not a cure but it is a good moisturizer to use on a baby with eczema, espeically for the face since my baby sucks on his hands, rubs it all over his cheeks and then takes it right back into his mouth.<br />I decided to take 3 tsps a day (now a bit more because I love the taste and texture so much) as a supplements since it has antifungal and lots of lauric acid (found in breastmilk) which strengthens the immune system.  I was hoping that some of it will get passed on to my milk and help my son fight his eczema from the inside.  Actually, I read that eating just 3 tsps a day, the lauric acid content in breastmilk jumps up from 3% to 9%.  As far as the results, I don't know if the coconut oil through my breastmimlk helped him but I sure got hooked!  I love the taste, texture, and look forward to taking my suuplemental tlbs.  I plan to bake with it this weekend and have asked my husband to use it for cooking as well.  I've rubbed some on my hands and face and it feels really soft and well moisturized.  I haven't tried it in my hair yet but plan too.  When I told my coworkers about my new obsession, they seemed a bit confused but really, read about the countless benefits and see how easy it is to substitue coconut oil for so many of your daily care and food.  I'm ordering the 54oz tub from a different brand from amazon today.",

After a 4 day juice fast, I started a vegetarian diet, with next to no meat (I currently don't eat meat or eggs, or any dairy products), HIGH plant fats, probably a couple pounds of fruits and veggies every day, and lots of coconut milk. Oh, and lets not forget beans and rice, unprocessed kinds of course. Despite my high fat diet, I am dropping fat weekly. While there may or may not be a profound effect with this oil, I can safely say that it hasn't added any fat. In fact, I am pretty certain that it aids in fat metabolisation. Plus, you get a rare type of MCT with this product, which makes up nearly 70% of the fat contained in the oil.<br /><br />On a side note... DON'T BE AFRAID OF PLANT FATS!! You want to lose weight? Stop eating processed foods (ALL TYPES), eat beans and bulk rice (Wild, Forbidden, Long Grain Brown, Red Rice etc..), nuts/seeds, nutbutter and coconut! Oh, and veggies too of course. Its easy AND CHEAP to eat well. It took me quite some time to be able to figure out how to eat so well on a less than stellar budget, but it can be done! &lt;3",

I usually have to drink two cups of green tea to get me going & maybe a cup of coffee if it's a very busy day but since I started using coconut oil, my energy level is higher and I get a lot more done without burning out.<br /><br />3)  It made me regular, not to be too detailed but you will have a movement after almost every meal.<br /><br />4) No morning breath!<br /><br />5)  Soft, silky skin & hair.<br /><br />6)  No toothache.  I had a cap that came loose so I had my dentist bond it back on but it kept bothering me as if it was infected or something but since I started using coconut oil, whatever was going on is totally healed.<br /><br />We are on our 2nd bottle already!

My sister eventually asked why I kept running my hands through my hair all day (I'm still doing it right now :D). And the reason for that is because it was softer and silkier, but MOSTLY it helped keep my hair tangle-free.<br /><br />Before I purchased this, I read some other reviews that claimed it was great for acne. I don't know why but it did not work for me. I only use a teeny bit on my face after a shower and the next day, I had a few whiteheads. At first I thought, \"well maybe its supposed to be like this before it gets any better\".. But it has been 5 days and it keeps getting worse. I am VERY disappointed. I don't know, maybe it is just my skin type.. I have dry, sensitive skin.<br /><br />So overall, I give it a 5 for hair treatment and 1 for \"skin clearing\".",

After doing a bit of research, I chose this product in particular due to the description, reviews, pricepoint, and the fact that it is a brand I have seen in many stores and am familiar with.<br /><br />The non-processed nature of this oil meets my skincare and haircare needs, but also makes it perfect for cooking as well. I bought it to use in the shower but now I cannot stop eating it on everything! It has a wonderfully light coconut smell and flavor, which is clearly natural and not from any artificial colorings or flavors. This is the best brand of coconut oil I have ever bought and it blends into my skin quickly and softly without feeling overly oily, tastes amazing, and washes out of my hair easily.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that it is packaged in a plastic container. While I am not too worried about the plastic leaching chemicals into the oil itself, I will be buying this product for the rest of my life and I'm sure I will be accumulating a lot of these plastic jars! Though they're recyclable, a glass jar would get reused immediately in my house. Other than that, I am perfectly pleased with this product! For the price, this can't be beat, it's worth spending the ~$10 to try it.<br /><br />Note: I couldn't find where this coconut product was harvested from on Amazon or the EfaGold website, but the bottle itself says it's a product of the Phillipines.",

It's like a miracle oil. Highly recommend it.",

We were ordering via \"subscribe and save\" the boxes of Zico, but when we saw the bottles of Zico in the store, he wanted to switch because he wanted a larger quantity at one time - he takes them to work and all of his games. He mentioned that it tasted different, but we didn't think much of it. Then, I noticed the \"from concentrate\" after looking at a bottle in the fridge. We are not paying \"top dollar\" for imitation coconut water and the explanation on their website was ridiculous. It is like can OJ! After doing my research on their website, I was angry that they switched the \"liquid\" going into the box vs. bottle. Never again! I immediately canceled our \"subscribe and save\" order. We our going to Henry's this week to purchase a variety of coconut waters and will \"subscribe and save\" to another brand that uses the real stuff!",

    "review_title": "Bummer: My fave packaged coconut water is RUINED!",
    "review_text": "Note: Please carefully review the NEGATIVE reviews before purchasing, as a Zico sales manager and probably others have been affecting the ratings/reviews/comments here due to original Zico drinkers posting critical reviews about this inferior new product that's nowhere near as good as original Zico. Be forewarned.<br /><br />~I've been drinking Zico for a couple years, getting my fix via amazon subscription. I and my sisters loved this stuff so much, I used to regularly order my shipments EARLY, and multiple cases at that.<br /><br />Well, that's it. They have officially lost me as a customer. After waiting impatiently for them to be back in stock in the natural (I hate the flavored ones), I just got the three cases I ordered.<br /><br />Oh, my goodness. I have three cases of this horror! I can't drink this!<br /><br />I don't know why they had to mess with a successful and deliciously refreshing beverage. I grew up drinking fresh coconut water (my family hails from the Caribbean), so I am well accustomed to the natural and subtle yumminess of coconut water. A chilled Zico used to be as close as I could get to the treat that is sipping from a straw right out of the chilled coconut that's had it's top sliced open for you on the spot (and it gets harder to find that in Metro Miami, but you still can).<br /><br />Now, it's not fit to drink. It smells funny. It tastes strange. The best I can describe it is that it reminds me of a watered-down version of the remainder-milk at the bottom of a bowl of Corn Pops when I was a kid--less sweet, more watery, but like that, with a chemically edge and a stale smell.<br /><br />How messed up is this?<br /><br />I can't believe someone gave this bottled version 5 stars! That's crazy. The OLD Zico deserved 5 stars. Not this. I hope those yoga places stop carrying it and tell Zico to bring back the fresh stuff. This sucks. I guess I better start mixing up these 35 bottles of zombie Zico with pomegranate juice or Acai Splash or something to cover up the taste and still benefit from the electrolytes. Hm.  I suspect there will be an upswing in sales for O.N.E. and VitaCoco and other brands in the old packaging. I've tried both of those (still have some ONE in the fridge from my order while I waited for Zico). Both were inferior to Old Zico. Both are preferable to New Zico.<br /><br />And someone please hand the president of Zico a bottle of this and ask hm if he REALLY thinks this is the taste of the stuff that made so many rabid fans, like I USED TO BE: past tense.<br /><br />Hey, Mr. Zico CEO, give me back my money!!!! You sold me rubbish!<br /><br />Okay, I ranted and got that off my chest. I do think having a recyclable bottle is great. The bottle feels good in the hand and makes it easy to add flavorings for those who prefer that. Easier to carry around. And I strongly suspect that those who are new to coconut water won't realize this has declined in flavor, so it's possible it can sell huge among the new initiates to the health benefits of coconut water.<br /><br />But I still miss old Zico.<br /><br />Note: I'm updating cause I found if I let the bottle sit with the cap off or  pour out into a glass, the funny smell dissipates and it's more drinkable. HTH.<br /><br />Update: Found a great replacement. Ordered Organic coconut water from amazon, brand Nature Factor. It's lovely. Lovely! So, at least I've found a happy replacement. Worth a try for those on the lookout for another tasty coconut water now that Zico sucks. Addendum: Found out that this brand uses very high heat to pasteurize and it may be nutrient compromised. If you mostly care about flavor, this one is great. If you are concerned about high heat, prolonged pasteurization, skip this one. HTH.<br /><br />2nd Update: I received a reply to an email I sent to Zico via their website. I was told that new Zico in the bottle tastes \"just like\" young Thai coconut water. That it's different from Brazilian c.w. and so takes getting used to. Hm. Well, I've had unprocessed/raw young Thai coconut water. I don't recall it making me wanna spit it out. :) Just sayin'.<br /><br />3rd Update: Saw a couple online taste tests that gave props to Amy & Brian, also available here on amazon,  so will be trying that, too, now that I'm coconut water peregrinating. Might be worth a shot to google up coconut water taste tests and see what might suit you if you aren't anti-can. ADDENDUM: Tried it, loved the first batch in the 17.5 oz cans. I emailed the company and it's just CW (not from concentrate) and it's FLASH Pasteurized, so the nutrient count should be comparable to other coconut waters in the tetra paks (though A&B will likely show a higher carb/calorie count due to its sweetness). If you're carb-counting, you may wanna compare. If your main concern is \"natural\" and tasty-sweet, then consider Amy & Brian's. Really nice. Warning: Ordered a second batch in the 10 oz cans, and it tasted odd. Candy-sweet, like candy that melted in water. So, I can no longer recommend this brand due to flavor inconsistencies on that scale. Pity, as my first order was AMAZING. boohoo<br /><br />4th Update: Old Zico from Brazilian coconuts will be back in September. If you liked old Zico, WAIT, don't buy this one. Also, in a letter from the Zico Sales Director to a reviewer here (see discussion for details), the Zico rep said they'd increased sodium in this bottled Asian CW Zico to \"optimize\" hydration benefits. So, it's not just that it's from concentrate, it's \"optimized\" to make it saltier. By optimized, I don't mean they ADDED sodium, but used a mix of coconuts to \"optimize.\" (Note: I know this cause the sales manager of Zico, Sherif P. Bates, replied to a discussion with a clarification, and this comment was posted under his own review post here. See discussion of comments under \"Todd O'Connor\". ) I don't know about y'all, but part of the reason why I like CW is that it's great to keep highish blood pressure normal due to its high Potassium. I do not need--and most Americans don't need--more sodium in their beverages or food. Maybe elite athletes sweating up a storm do, but not the rest of us who just exercise moderately (or not at all). So, there you go: New Zico. More sodium, less flavor.<br /><br />Note about reviews: Do check the reviewer's profile. If a reviewer is five-star (or four-star, even) raving about this product and has only reviews for Zico products and has no verified amazon purchase, find a grain of salt to toy with. That's no guarantee, naturally, but sometimes is a clue to...well, you can guess. (Note: See comments under the review by \"Todd O'Connor\" and under Alio \"Alio\"s review for an explanation of how I learned about ONE fake review and Alio \"Alio\" confirming the fake identity.)",

Vita coco is clearly a superior product as it is 100% with no concentrates; although, Zico I would put on the same scale.  It does not taste like 100% coconut water nor does it taste like plastic.  It tastes like coconut water from concentrate and I do not mean that in  a bad way.  You just have to take risks in life, check out a case when they are on sale (around $11) and give this product a try!  It is a little different but the change is nice!",

I also like O.N.E; vita coco isn't bad either.  I figured that if I like zico in the 11oz carton, why not order the 14oz bottle?  Big mistake... unlike the product in the 11oz carton, this bottled stuff absolutely misrepresents authentic coconut water.  It has an after taste like sour milk.  I've tasted spoiled coconut water before in the caribbean, and even that tastes better than the new zico.  I have never felt so compelled to write a review about a product before.  I hope zico stops making their \"new\" product from concentrate, and gets back to what made their coconut water such a wonderful product in the first place.

At trader joes, Zico costs about 2 bucks, which is the same price for C20 coconut water and Vitacoco which both do NOT have \"natural flavors\" added to it and are NOT from concentrate. The packaging advertises \"30 percent less sugar\"...well that's because they took out 30% of the coconut water and replaced it with water. It was so nasty that they had to add \"natural flavors\". Do not buy this brand. When I was a little kid I used to suck on my water squirt guns and the taste of this coconut water resembles that-like plastic/water with a small hint of coconut water. The other brands are so much better and are actually natural. For the same price, go get a coconut water that is not from concentrate. My favorite is C20.",

It wasn't until I was at the local supermarket and tried the Zico Chocolate Coconut Water and fell in love with my first \"health drink\".<br /><br />I would strongly recommend that you try this great drink before supplies run out!  It's a very popular drink and according to the agriculture website coconuts are becoming harder to get because of the broadened use of coconut water and milk.

It tastes like coconut water to me with a slight extra taste of mango. Well, I'm not particularly interested in the mango taste, it's the ingredient mix in the water that is of interest. The mango taste just makes it a bit more tasty to someone who is not used to coconut water. And, except for the slight flavoring this is pure coconut water. Nothing else. I used to be a marathoner and we used to look for things like this. It's the mix of electrolytes that's important and this drink is impressive. It would be very good for relief of cramps and restoring lost body fluids when you pour out a lot of sweat. I wish I'd had it in my marathoning days.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",

    "review_title": "Still Amazing!!!",
    "review_text": "I was never a really big fan of ZICO natural before ... until the bottle came out. Honestly, I absolutely LOVE, LOVE the nuttier flavor and can't drink enough of it. It's significanlty more drinkable for someone who's never had coconut water a part of their daily diet.  The original flavors are great, Mango and Passion. I first fell in love with ZICO by drinking the Passion, then I started to wanting less flavor and transitioned to Mango. But never full latched onto natural. Though, I've been wanting to make the switch.<br /><br />With the bottle now, it's what I've been waiting for. I LOVE IT!!! It's amazing to just chug it cold after a hard work out, and you know it's packed with natural electrolytes, potassium, and so much more. Great for your skin and internal system. Overall it's just an amazing beverage. I can't stop raving about it to all my friends, family, and fellow athletes. Currently, I'm training for an aquathon, and I don't know how I did it before. But there's no going back now.<br /><br />My other favorite in the bottle is Lima Citron. It's so tasty. It just brings me back to my childhood since the smell reminds me of Fruit Loops! And it taste just as yummy, but sooo much better for you.<br /><br />Look I'll be honest. The bottle isn't tetra, and it's not meant to be. Tetra is great in it's own right, but this new line has proposed another fabulous alternative to all those who love coconut water but needed more versility with the on-go lifestyle. So credit is due for that.<br /><br />I'm super stoked that ZICO gave us consumers two options: tetra and bottle. And I'm going to enjoy both fully!! It's just wonderful to switch up the flavors. Somedays I'll have Natural others Mango. When I'm training, it'll be the bottle. At the office, it'll be the tetra. Any way you look at it, ZICO is helping me be healthier whether it's in the bottle or tetra.  It's just a personal preference at this point. So try it and be your own judge.<br /><br />Besides when I found out that the bottle is actually more environmentally friendly, I was happily surprised. Tetra isn't recylced by many plants nationally. 30% of the bottle is made from recylced materials and is 100% recylcable(including the cap - unlike water bottles). Personally, this is important to me.<br /><br />And I agree with the other reviewers with regards to the concentrate and the decrease of their carbon foot print. It's true and relevant.<br /><br />ZICO, thank you for the amazing products you continue to give to us, and most importantly thank you for promoting a healthier, more hydrated lifestyle in a fabulously tasty way via bottle or tetra. Here's to you in breaking the mold and trying to help more people with your new bottle while still keeping tetra for those who've become so loyal. Hat's off!!! You've now acquired another fan for life!!!<br /><br />Cheers!!!!<br /><br />P.S. ZICO is still amazing.",

That is, there was a compartmentalized container with the liter bottles carefully packed within, this box was surrounded by air bag packaging and packed within a larger sturdy cardboard container.  Great packaging.<br />  My wife uses this product and her comments follow:  As to the taste.  I found I prefer Zico over the other brands as it doesn't appear to have any \"hidden\" sugar added to hype up the taste.  My previous brand, Vita Coco,  did not declare added sugar, but it did leave that sugared drink after taste in my mouth and was noticeably sweeter.<br />  I cannot say that I particularly like the taste of coconut water, but it has the nutritional potassium I need in my diet, and is easier to keep around than bananas and has less calories.",

At first, I was disappointed; the first taste seemed rather bland (and it was somewhat warm).  The next day, I drank another carton (cold now) and it wasn't too bad.  The third day I found myself looking forward to getting home to drink a carton of this stuff!  Now, I love it so much I've subscribed to regular deliveries.  For me, the mango flavor is the best.

I prefer my coffee without added tastes.<br /><br />I prepared the Starbucks Vanilla Flavored in a Cuisinart drip-machine per the instructions on the package - 10 grams of coffee to each 6 ounces of water. I used a Melitta brown paper filter. I found the brewed coffee extremely bitter and not very flavorful. I experimented with varying the coffee/water ratio to try to get a better result, but was unsuccessful.<br /><br />I'm convinced that brewing coffee is one of the \"dark arts\" and that's why I give this Starbucks 3 stars rather than 1 or 2.

    "review_text": "As a self-confessed coffee addict for the past 20 years, I'd like to think that I'm a good judge of coffee.  Yes, if you poke through my previous reviews, you'll see that I rated a bag of Yuban (Breakfast Blend) rather highly.  So you may be surprised at my middling review of a bag of Starbucks and might therefore brand me a \"hater\". I am not. I love their Sumatran, Komodo Dragon, Anniversary Blend and their Christmas Blend.  AND, I was really looking forward a \"subtle flavor\" of vanilla in a cup of coffee. Now that we're all clear:<br /><br />Opening the bag of Starbucks Natural Infusions Vanilla, you'll immediately be hit by the scent of vanilla.  I was a bit scared that the coffee would wind up overpoweringly vanilla once brewed, but it wasn't so.  The vanilla is pronounced, but not overpowering once brewed.  HOWEVER, once brewed, the coffee beans' origin is immediately obvious.  The bag says \"Latin American beans\" but what they mean is Colombian. There's no mistaking that distinctive scent or taste.  Also, this is not a dark roast, not a bold coffee; it's a tame pseudo-breakfast roast.  It is a bit oily, but not overly so. (As another reviewer noted, this may be due to the added glycerin.)<br /><br />Point of interest: I drip brewed 6 cups for my initial tasting and did not add anything nor doctor the brew.  And onto the taste: very Colombian coffee, definitely vanilla, mildly sweet.  Starbucks not only added vanilla to the ground coffee, but they also added sarsparilla root and \"natural flavor\" including corn maltodextrin.  This is likely why it comes off as sweet when served black.<br /><br />The vanilla flavor is there, make no mistake.  And the sweetness is there too.  No, this isn't as pronounced as adding a shot of flavored syrup to your coffee, but it isn't as subtle as the packaging would have us believe. If you like flavored coffee, this is right up your alley.  But, a note to coffee drinkers who like their coffee strong and bitter: this is not the coffee for you!<br /><br />I don't hate this coffee, but I don't love it.  If someone served it to me, I'd drink it (black) and not complain... until I got home.  ;-)",

Flavor coffees, I have found, are usually hit or miss, in my experience more miss.  However, in the case of this coffee I found the vanilla flavor to be rather subtle.<br /><br />This coffee is not a dark and/or strong blend; it is rather mild so the discreet hints of vanilla give this beverage a smooth taste.  I used flavored creamer when I drank this coffee. My first cup I used hazelnut and my second cup I used pumpkin spice.  I found the hints of vanilla gleamed out rather nice with both of these flavor creams.  I haven't used it with basic cream, but I am sure the taste would still be pleasant.  I think anyone who really enjoys coffee should at least allow their mug to associate with this Starbuck blend at least once.",

The vanilla is strong enough that I didn't wonder what the flavor was supposed to be. It is definitely vanilla but without a cloying fake taste.

    "review_text": "When Starbucks says natural, that's what they mean! I was surprised to open this bag of coffee and immediately smelled vanilla extract. It was so similar I got my little container of vanilla extract out of the cupboard and compared the two. This ground coffee definitely has natural flavoring. Unfortunately, I think it's a little too natural and too strong for my preferences.<br /><br />You know when you bake and a recipe calls for maybe a teaspoon of vanilla extract? That's because it's strong stuff! I'm convinced that the same approach wasn't taken when creating this coffee--no \"less is more\" approach when it comes to Starbucks using natural fusions, I suppose.<br /><br />Once I got past the smell, because I was still determined to taste it, I was pleasantly surprised. The taste is a lot more subtle than the scent. It still takes like coffee, not something spiced up like chai or other unnaturally flavored coffees. It has subtle spicy taste to it along with the natural vanilla. I attribute this to the sarsaparilla root. It made for an alright cup of coffee. It would be better if I couldn't smell it.<br /><br />I finished my mug, but I think I'll be passing the rest of the pack on to someone else who wants to try it and stick with my Starbucks House Blend or Breakfast Blend.<br /><br />FYI, Ingredients: ground coffee, natural flavor (with corn maltodextrin, vegetable glycerin), ground vanilla beans, Indian sarsaparilla root",

That time around we all detected a slight bitterness. One person called the aftertaste \"chemically,\" despite Starbucks' assertion of all natural flavorings.<br /><br />The next day, we brewed a third batch in our preferred coffee maker, a french press. The vanilla flavor was more pronounced, but so was the bitterness. None of us finished our individual cups of the french press brewed batch. In Starbucks defense, using a press ignores their directions which specifically say to use a \"machine,\" so we did not weigh this batch heavily in our rating.<br /><br />Overall, we agreed that it is drinkable, but not worth the premium price. Occasional drinkers of not very strong coffee would probably rate this product one star higher.",

I also have a commitment to purchasing fair trade, sustainably grown, bird-friendly coffee, and Starbucks does not qualify on any of those counts.

    "review_text": "UGH!  I had just discovered the rich roasted with slight vanilla flavor and then I buy a second bag and was shocked to see the light roast of any cheap flavored coffee.  I called in to their customer service and of course they didn't know what I was talking about.  I love Starbucks for the rich bold roast and now this new version is just like the Dunkin Donat or other flavored water that they pass off as coffee.  I realize they are probably trying to get those customers that like crappy brown water but come on Starbucks remember your BRAND IDENTITY!!!!!",

The recommended amount of coffee, 2 tablespoons per 6 oz, is a very, very strong cup of joe. I like strong coffee but 2 T per 6 oz of water is too strong even for me so I brewed it at about 2T for 10oz of water which is still a really strong cup of coffee.<br /><br />My second cup I brewed the same as the first but added Coffee Mate Peppermint Mocha powdered creamer - super tasty. I like that creamer flavor and I wanted to see how the vanilla would stand out. Really it got lost in the stronger flavor of the creamer. There wasn't much vanilla to cover in the first place.

Since we don't have a Starbucks in the little town that I live in and what they have in the grocery store is so expensive I haven't had a chance to till now.

So I usually have to cut it 2 to 1 or ½ & ½ with some Folgers to get the level of Vanilla flavor that I like.  But this Starbucks Vanilla Coffee doesn't seem to have very much Vanilla flavor to it at all. I made the first pot of it like I usually do with the flavored coffee's and mixed it 2 to 1, 2 parts Starbucks to 1 part Folgers. I could hardly taste the Vanilla at all in that pot so the next one I made with just the Starbucks coffee. This time it had a slight and very light Vanilla flavor. It was still a very good pot of coffee but it didn't have much of a Vanilla flavor to it.<br />  So if your looking for a flavored coffee with a lot of Vanilla to it then you will be disappointed.

I simply cannot stand what many people like, the common watered-down breakfast or house blends - yuk. I do like an occasional flavored coffee if done right. This time, however, Starbucks simply ruined the concept with that hideous alcohol after bite. If I brew with less coffee, I lose the delicious robustness of the star - the coffee.

This vanilla-flavored coffee comes ground, which saves me the step of grinding the beans myself.  Even though the beans are pre-ground, the flavor after brewing was still deep and rich, and the aromatic fragrance of vanilla still permeated after I opened the vacuum sealed bag.<br /><br />The flavoring of the vanilla in this coffee is subtle and mild.  I mention this because with some flavored coffees, a particular flavor can be quite distinct and strong, and dominate the taste of the coffee.  For me personally, that can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the particular flavor; I like pumpkin spice strongly flavored, while I prefer cinnamon and vanilla to be more subtle.  So, if you are looking for heavily flavored vanilla coffee, expect something a bit more subtle with this flavor.<br /><br />At 11 ounces, this is not a terribly large quantity of coffee for the money.  That said, however, Starbucks has never been the bargain hunter's choice for economical coffee, and this is reasonably priced in relation to other speciality coffees.",

    "review_text": "This review is for Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2). The packaging for this shipment was appropriate, as was the actual bag containing the ground coffee, which included a way for re-sealing to maintain freshness.<br /><br />As for the taste of the coffee, which is really the most important factor, I was not that fond of the vanilla aspect of the flavor. I'm not certain why, but vanilla in Coffeemate tastes fine to me, but the vanilla 'infusion' into this coffee simply tasted too artificial for my palate, even when adding a non-flavored creamer. My advice is to add flavor to your coffee, if desired, only after the brewing process.",

When I saw this Vanilla flavored coffee, though I am a coffee purist, I thought I would try it. Honestly, I've had pleasant vanilla coffee and this was far from it. The vanilla flavor was just strong enough to make it taste odd, but not strong enough to really identify the vanilla flavors. I would not recommend this coffee.",

    "review_text": "This coffee is finely ground, so it has a good powdery consistency. Typically this means you'll need to use less of it for brewing. My wife and I like strong coffee, but this coffee is very strong, almost to the point that it's muddy.<br /><br />The coffee smells like vanilla, that's not an issue. However, I feel that the coffee blend overpowers the vanilla flavor. The coffee appears to be so darkly-roasted that you taste more coffee than vanilla. This coffee tastes better with milk added, which helps cut through the bitterness of the blend.<br /><br />The bag is typical packaging designed to keep the coffee fresh. Once opened, it can be folded down and sealed with an attached wire clip. The bag is imprinted with a bonus: take the empty bag to a Starbucks, and you get a free \"tall\" coffee.<br /><br />It's coffee, but not something I would enjoy on a regular basis. This may be a once-a-week blend for me. It's just too strong and lacks a clear vanilla balance.",

    "review_text": "I'm not a HUGE coffee drinker but I do like to keep some in the house so that once in a blue moon we can enjoy a cup or have some when friends or family visits.  Being that I'm not accustomed to drinking coffee, I'm VERY, VERY sensitive taste wise to coffees that are really bitter, have a strong, overpowering flavor and ESPECIALLY those who leave a nasty aftertaste in the mouth.  In other words, for an inexperienced coffee drinker, I'm VERY picky about my coffee.<br /><br />Right when I opened the bag to this Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored Ground Coffee, I smelled this wonderful, coffee and authentic vanilla aroma that I felt compelled to make a batch immediately just to try it.  Both my husband and I thought it was delicious.  It's very smooth - it doesn't have a harsh 'bite' to it at all, the vanilla flavor in it tastes very 'real' and not some horrid chemical rendition of vanilla and again, didn't leave a bad aftertaste.  I served it to family who visited who are AVID coffee drinkers and they enjoyed it as well - actually asked me what brand it was.<br /><br />For those of you who enjoy your flavored coffees, Vanilla is a GREAT flavor to have on hand since you can do so many things to it in my opinion.  I added some cocoa powder to the grounds one time to make a vanilla - chocolate coffee (YUM!), another time I added cinnamon (DOUBLE YUM!) and another time, Pumpkin Pie spices (hubby didn't like this but I did).  Two thumbs up for me!",

I must first caveat my review by saying that I love many of the offerings at the local Starbucks store, but I am not a huge fan of their coffee.  In the case of this Natural Fusions Vanilla flavored coffee, I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Some vanilla-infused coffees have a harsh, chemical taste, or taste more like vanilla than coffee.  Starbucks seems to have found a good balance between vanilla and coffee flavors.  The vanilla is not overpowering, but you know it is there.  The components of vanilla come from ground vanilla beans and Indian sarsaparilla root.<br /><br />I was a little taken aback by two of the items on the ingredient list.  Corn Maltodextrin?  Is it just a filler, or is it there for sweetness?  Vegetable Glycerin?<br /><br />Overall, this coffee is a notch above some of the other vanilla infused coffees out there, and I would recommend it for the occasional cup.",

Brewing instructions state that two rounded tablespoons should be used per cup which is way too much unless you want to grow hair on your chest. Another tip - some reviewers have mentioned bitterness - a pinch of kosher salt added to the coffee grounds which counteracts bitterness. After drinking this, I'm looking forward to trying the caramel flavor. However, the price of this small 11 oz. bag is way too expensive and I can find equally good coffee for half this price at my local market.",

One nice touch is you can take the empty bag into a Starbuck's and get a free coffee.",

Genuine vanilla, just like coffee has a pretty wide range of flavors and quality levels.  This one may be natural but its not quality.

The smell of the flavoring--be it real vanilla, imitation vanilla, or something that isn't vanilla at all but smells like someone's idea of vanilla--escapes even from the sealed bag to the point I decided not to keep this coffee near the rest of my stash. After opening the bag, I involuntarily snapped my head away, fearing my olfactory system might be under siege by the sickly sweet smell.<br /><br />Next was to try this coffee, and I admit my courage faltered when I considered what an unadulterated cup of this vanilla flavored coffee might taste like in the morning as I prepared the coffee and set the timer. So I mixed in a good dose of regular coffee, probably three-fifths regular, two-fifths vanilla flavored.<br /><br />Well, first impression is that using the word \"natural\" to describe this flavor would be a reach until I remembered that just because something does not have an appealing smell does not mean it is not natural and that perhaps these vanilla bean received the same treatment as civet coffee. The coffee seems to burn slightly as it goes down, and tastes overly sweet even without any extra sweetener. I needed that second cup at 6:15 a.m. far more than I wanted it, and I will not be drinking this brew again except as iced coffee and even then, not without cutting it with some regular coffee to help constrain the cloying flavor that coats the back-of-the-throat like the taste of some awful medicine.",

Very smooth and overall good taste.<br /><br />The ingredients on the side of the package says:  Ground coffee, natural flavor (with corn maltodextrin, vegetable glycerin), ground vanilla beans, Indian sarsaparilla root.  Also on the bag it says, \"To preserve that fresh just roasted flavor, keep this bag sealed tight in a cabinet (not the refrigerator) and brew within a week of opening.\"<br /><br />Overall I liked it.  If you want a coffee with just a hint of flavor, I would recommend this.  However, if you are used to lattes loaded with milk, cream, sugar and other flavorings, you probably won't taste much of a difference between this and unflavored coffee.",

It makes my house smell terrific.<br /><br />Drinking it, I found that it's smooth and drinks really easily. There's a little bit of bitterness (which I don't mind but some people might) and doesn't taste acidic at all to me, though I am not an expert coffee taster and might be getting my terms wrong. The vanilla flavor is really subtle. I could do with a little more vanilla, and I can see why people are dissatisfied with the slightness of the flavor. What little bit is present, though, is a really nice vanilla taste and not the aftertastey yuck a lot of flavored coffees have.<br /><br />I think I'm going to have my flavored-coffee-hating roommate try this too. (Edited to add: Roomie liked it, commenting that it didn't have that fakey syrup taste; roomie didn't like the strong vanilla aroma as much as I did, though.) This could be a good coffee to try if you like vanilla flavor in theory but find most vanilla-flavored coffees too strong or too fake-y.<br /><br />Overall I'm quite pleased with this coffee.",

That one was more like a regular cup of coffee, though, less strong and complex than the Starbucks variety described here, though the vanilla flavoring had about the same flavor and strength in both coffees.<br /><br />It's all a matter of personal taste.  Some people like a no-nonsense coffee like the Melitta and some like the gourmet richness of a Starbucks.  Myself, I go back and forth.  And when I'm in the latter mood, and also in the mood for a flavored coffee, I wouldn't hesitate to pick up this quality Starbucks offering.",

I was not blown away by subtle essences of vanilla; it did smell pretty good while brewing, which I suppose is the aim of coffee in general (one of the Top Ten Smells in the world, IMO, is a good coffee brewing up), but the flavor wasn't any more spectacular than any other coffee on the market. I would categorize it as robust, full-bodied, and - good. Not wow, do-cartwheels, jump-up-and-down...just that - good.

This mostly medium roast has an unmistakable but not obnoxious vanilla perfume upon opening.

It is not overly sweet and wears on the palate well over the course of a few cups.<br /><br />I you are the type who doctors your coffee up with flavored sugars and/or creamers the subtleties of this coffee may not matter to you.

The vanilla flavoring is a very gentle and light taste, almost a whisper soft hint.  In addition, the taste is not bitter, but smooth and delicious.  I am one who drinks with a bit of sugar and cream, rather than straight black, as well as being rather picky on my coffee, as it bothers my stomach if it is overly acidic.

As to \"strength\" I wish that there was more coffee in each K-cup... I am accustomed to Starbuck's strength, and I have to set my Keurig to medium-cup size to get the strength I need.  This is not as cost-effective as -- say Jet Fuel (but I found Jet Fuel too bitter.)<br />If Wolfgang Puck would add more coffee to its K-cups, this would be a perfect coffee for me.",

I like it on thenext to highest setting on my Keurig....it has an awesome aroma while brewing and the taste is smooth, never bitter and there is something that 'hints' of a slight fruitiness with the first sips......then the end of the sip is just a perfect brew, too. Never any aftertaste or bitterness. I am so happy to have found this!! Thanks Wolfgang! I have now ALL of your kitchen gadgets cookware and now the coffee too!",

    "review_text": "First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG\">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ\">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.",

My husband loves the GM brand most of the coffees are mild (even when they say medium roast)...I go for a little more on the medium roast like the some of the Tully's and Caribou brands.  It used to be that we were always ordering the same brands, once we liked a certain one.  But I ventured to try the Wolfgang Puck line.  While this flavor is touted as a medium roast, it seems to be more on the bold side with a little bitterness.  It is still not a bad coffee, just not as good as the \"Rodeo Drive\" or \"Breakfast in Bed\" k-cups which has no bitterness.  I must say though, we have now added the latter 2 flavors of Wolfgang to our buying ritual.",

Decent aroma, but taste is muted compared to, for example, a Diedrich French roast.  I don't hate or even dislike it, it's 'okay', and for the price I paid, is acceptable without complaint.  It may make an acceptable guest coffee for those wanting something a little bolder without being over the top rich.<br /><br />I'd call it mildly bold, average, and I won't be going out of my way to keep it on hand.",

Some have worked well; others have not. Some are too mild; some are a bit \"off\" on taste.<br /><br />This Wolfgang Puck product is one of the more successful experiments with the Keurig machine. It has a rich taste and still remains smooth. Not too strong a flavor, but it does have flavor.<br /><br />So, the two coffee drinkers in my household are quite pleased to drink this brew.",

    "review_text": "I am not a huge morning coffee person as this seems to be the only time of day black coffee upsets my stomach. No idea why. My work got a Keurig recently and buy the Caribou regular and morning blends, which are ok but I can hardly drink them unless there's a creamer of some sort in them.<br /><br />So on a recent trip to BB&B I perused their wall of K-cups and this one caught my eye. I am generally a fan of flavored coffees and this sounded good, so I bought an 18 cup pack. I have to say it is delicious! The coconut flavor is light but definitely there, and doesn't leave a bitter aftertaste like most black coffees do. It smells so good my co-workers have done a 180 walking by my desk to ask me what smells so good.<br /><br />Obviously if you're a coffee connoisseur this won't be for you, but if not it is definitely worth a shot. And the best part for me, aside from the flavor, no stomach upset!",

I like my coffee strong, and before buying a K cup coffee maker, always purchased French roast whole bean and brewed strong coffee.  Brewing this in a K cup machine at an 8 ounce cup will definately provide you with a strong cup of coffee.  Since I brew a cup for my wife and I at the same time, I run two 8 ounce cups with one of these K cups into a small decanter, and then pour into two coffee cups, which still yields a strong flavor, but not enough pop your eyeballs out...<br /><br />Of course, brewing two cups with one K cup drops the price down in half, which at less than thirty cents a cup is on the cheap end of K cup brewing.  I find most K cups are good for up to a 12 ounce cup, and 16 ounces would weaken them too much...  But this works for my wife and I since I have been fixing a cup for each of us for years, and brewing two cups with one K cup is economical.",

It is flavored.<br /><br />The first thing you notice is a deep coconut aroma, almost akin to Hazelnut in its presentation. The initial mouthfeel is good, a light roast but a snappiness to the roast which settles in nicely with the flavor, which<br />has a definite dark chocolate taste without the bitterness.<br /><br />The finish is semisweet chocolate, Jamaican coffee and faint toasted coconut.<br /><br />Bottom Line: if you like flavored coffee with coconut/hazelnut/cocoa profiles, you will like this coffee.",

    "review_text": "First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG\">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ\">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.",

It used to be that we were always ordering the same brands, once we liked a certain one.  But I ventured to try the Wolfgang Puck line.  While this flavor is touted as a medium roast, it seems to be more on the bold side with a little bitterness.

A full 1/3 of the cups brewed are undrinkable.  They are slow to brew(coffee maker has to work very hard) and even then the cup retains an inordinate amount of water.  Checking some of the cups that left grounds in the brew showed that the filter was not properly installed.  They could sell these at half the price listed and you still would pay too much due to all the wasted coffee.  I believe we all have experienced a defective cup here or there but these are way beyond acceptable.",

I am generally a fan of flavored coffees and this sounded good, so I bought an 18 cup pack. I have to say it is delicious! The coconut flavor is light but definitely there, and doesn't leave a bitter aftertaste like most black coffees do. It smells so good my co-workers have done a 180 walking by my desk to ask me what smells so good.<br /><br />Obviously if you're a coffee connoisseur this won't be for you, but if not it is definitely worth a shot.

I like my coffee strong, and before buying a K cup coffee maker, always purchased French roast whole bean and brewed strong coffee.  Brewing this in a K cup machine at an 8 ounce cup will definately provide you with a strong cup of coffee.  Since I brew a cup for my wife and I at the same time, I run two 8 ounce cups with one of these K cups into a small decanter, and then pour into two coffee cups, which still yields a strong flavor, but not enough pop your eyeballs out...<br /><br />Of course, brewing two cups with one K cup drops the price down in half, which at less than thirty cents a cup is on the cheap end of K cup brewing.  I find most K cups are good for up to a 12 ounce cup, and 16 ounces would weaken them too much...  But this works for my wife and I since I have been fixing a cup for each of us for years, and brewing two cups with one K cup is economical.",

    "review_title": "Unremarkable",
    "review_text": "First, let me say that I prefer extra-bold K-Cup coffees and only occasionally drink a medium blend, and never decaf. I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG\">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ\">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.",

My husband loves the GM brand most of the coffees are mild (even when they say medium roast)...I go for a little more on the medium roast like the some of the Tully's and Caribou brands.  It used to be that we were always ordering the same brands, once we liked a certain one.  But I ventured to try the Wolfgang Puck line.  While this flavor is touted as a medium roast, it seems to be more on the bold side with a little bitterness.  It is still not a bad coffee, just not as good as the \"Rodeo Drive\" or \"Breakfast in Bed\" k-cups which has no bitterness.  I must say though, we have now added the latter 2 flavors of Wolfgang to our buying ritual.",

Exception to the rule would be for dark, bold coffees such as French roasts, which I really enjoy.  So when Wolfgang Puck's French roast turned up on Amazon's deal of the week, even though I have never tried before, now I have 48 units.<br /><br />It's fairly non-descript for a French roast.  Decent aroma, but taste is muted compared to, for example, a Diedrich French roast.  I don't hate or even dislike it, it's 'okay', and for the price I paid, is acceptable without complaint.  It may make an acceptable guest coffee for those wanting something a little bolder without being over the top rich.<br /><br />I'd call it mildly bold, average, and I won't be going out of my way to keep it on hand.",

    "review_text": "I caught this as a \"Warehouse\" deal. $18.09 for 48 K-cups. This was my first experience with any Wolfgang Puck coffee.<br />The Rodeo Drive Blend is good, average coffee. Nothing exceptional. I prefer a little stronger, bolder coffee, but at this price, it works for me. There's other brands that I like a little better, but with K-cups, cost per unit is always something I have to factor in...<br />I'd buy it again @ $0.38/cup, but I probably wouldn't @ full price. If you keep your eyes peeled, you can always find a good deal... just have to be patient and stock up when the deals arise.",

My work got a Keurig recently and buy the Caribou regular and morning blends, which are ok but I can hardly drink them unless there's a creamer of some sort in them.<br /><br />So on a recent trip to BB&B I perused their wall of K-cups and this one caught my eye. I am generally a fan of flavored coffees and this sounded good, so I bought an 18 cup pack. I have to say it is delicious! The coconut flavor is light but definitely there, and doesn't leave a bitter aftertaste like most black coffees do. It smells so good my co-workers have done a 180 walking by my desk to ask me what smells so good.<br /><br />Obviously if you're a coffee connoisseur this won't be for you, but if not it is definitely worth a shot.

I like my coffee strong, and before buying a K cup coffee maker, always purchased French roast whole bean and brewed strong coffee.  Brewing this in a K cup machine at an 8 ounce cup will definately provide you with a strong cup of coffee.  Since I brew a cup for my wife and I at the same time, I run two 8 ounce cups with one of these K cups into a small decanter, and then pour into two coffee cups, which still yields a strong flavor, but not enough pop your eyeballs out...<br /><br />Of course, brewing two cups with one K cup drops the price down in half, which at less than thirty cents a cup is on the cheap end of K cup brewing.  I find most K cups are good for up to a 12 ounce cup, and 16 ounces would weaken them too much...  But this works for my wife and I since I have been fixing a cup for each of us for years, and brewing two cups with one K cup is economical.",

It is flavored.<br /><br />The first thing you notice is a deep coconut aroma, almost akin to Hazelnut in its presentation. The initial mouthfeel is good, a light roast but a snappiness to the roast which settles in nicely with the flavor, which<br />has a definite dark chocolate taste without the bitterness.<br /><br />The finish is semisweet chocolate, Jamaican coffee and faint toasted coconut.<br /><br />Bottom Line: if you like flavored coffee with coconut/hazelnut/cocoa profiles, you will like this coffee.",

I bought three Wolfgang Puck coffees several months ago: Rodeo Drive Blend; French Roast; and Sumatra Kopi Raya. All three are quite drinkable, though they do not measure up to a few of the extra-bold blends from Coffee People: Kona Blend; Organic Blend; Jet Fuel; and Black Tiger. Even better than these, though, is my new favorite, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003M7TTYG\">Green Mountain's Revv</a>. Those who prefer a strong, dark cup of coffee (even at the larger mug setting) should try that brand.<br /><br />Previously, I had found the dark-roast Green Mountain coffees rather boring, but Revv lives up to the hype, both in strength and flavor. Another great Green Mountain coffee is their Espresso Blend (though Amazon doesn't stock it, so the prices tend to be higher here than in brick-and-mortar stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond). Finally, a favorite regular over the years has been <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ\">Emeril's Big Easy Bold</a>. It's a very nice coffee, though don't expect the New Orleans experience of chicory flavor.<br /><br />Bottom line: You won't go wrong with the Wolfgang Puck coffees, but for my taste they do not stand out among the available bold coffees.",

It used to be that we were always ordering the same brands, once we liked a certain one.  But I ventured to try the Wolfgang Puck line.  While this flavor is touted as a medium roast, it seems to be more on the bold side with a little bitterness.  It is still not a bad coffee, just not as good as the \"Rodeo Drive\" or \"Breakfast in Bed\" k-cups which has no bitterness.

    "review_text": "I really like to mix things up with k-cups and rarely buy 50-ct boxes of a single flavor.  Exception to the rule would be for dark, bold coffees such as French roasts, which I really enjoy.  So when Wolfgang Puck's French roast turned up on Amazon's deal of the week, even though I have never tried before, now I have 48 units.<br /><br />It's fairly non-descript for a French roast.  Decent aroma, but taste is muted compared to, for example, a Diedrich French roast.  I don't hate or even dislike it, it's 'okay', and for the price I paid, is acceptable without complaint.  It may make an acceptable guest coffee for those wanting something a little bolder without being over the top rich.<br /><br />I'd call it mildly bold, average, and I won't be going out of my way to keep it on hand.",

Checking some of the cups that left grounds in the brew showed that the filter was not properly installed.  They could sell these at half the price listed and you still would pay too much due to all the wasted coffee.

I am generally a fan of flavored coffees and this sounded good, so I bought an 18 cup pack. I have to say it is delicious! The coconut flavor is light but definitely there, and doesn't leave a bitter aftertaste like most black coffees do.

I like my coffee strong, and before buying a K cup coffee maker, always purchased French roast whole bean and brewed strong coffee.  Brewing this in a K cup machine at an 8 ounce cup will definately provide you with a strong cup of coffee.  Since I brew a cup for my wife and I at the same time, I run two 8 ounce cups with one of these K cups into a small decanter, and then pour into two coffee cups, which still yields a strong flavor, but not enough pop your eyeballs out...<br /><br />Of course, brewing two cups with one K cup drops the price down in half, which at less than thirty cents a cup is on the cheap end of K cup brewing.  I find most K cups are good for up to a 12 ounce cup, and 16 ounces would weaken them too much...  But this works for my wife and I since I have been fixing a cup for each of us for years, and brewing two cups with one K cup is economical.",

He mentioned that it tasted different, but we didn't think much of it. Then, I noticed the \"from concentrate\" after looking at a bottle in the fridge. We are not paying \"top dollar\" for imitation coconut water and the explanation on their website was ridiculous. It is like can OJ! After doing my research on their website, I was angry that they switched the \"liquid\" going into the box vs. bottle. Never again! I immediately canceled our \"subscribe and save\" order.

    "review_title": "Bummer: My fave packaged coconut water is RUINED!",
    "review_text": "Note: Please carefully review the NEGATIVE reviews before purchasing, as a Zico sales manager and probably others have been affecting the ratings/reviews/comments here due to original Zico drinkers posting critical reviews about this inferior new product that's nowhere near as good as original Zico. Be forewarned.<br /><br />~I've been drinking Zico for a couple years, getting my fix via amazon subscription. I and my sisters loved this stuff so much, I used to regularly order my shipments EARLY, and multiple cases at that.<br /><br />Well, that's it. They have officially lost me as a customer. After waiting impatiently for them to be back in stock in the natural (I hate the flavored ones), I just got the three cases I ordered.<br /><br />Oh, my goodness. I have three cases of this horror! I can't drink this!<br /><br />I don't know why they had to mess with a successful and deliciously refreshing beverage. I grew up drinking fresh coconut water (my family hails from the Caribbean), so I am well accustomed to the natural and subtle yumminess of coconut water. A chilled Zico used to be as close as I could get to the treat that is sipping from a straw right out of the chilled coconut that's had it's top sliced open for you on the spot (and it gets harder to find that in Metro Miami, but you still can).<br /><br />Now, it's not fit to drink. It smells funny. It tastes strange. The best I can describe it is that it reminds me of a watered-down version of the remainder-milk at the bottom of a bowl of Corn Pops when I was a kid--less sweet, more watery, but like that, with a chemically edge and a stale smell.<br /><br />How messed up is this?<br /><br />I can't believe someone gave this bottled version 5 stars! That's crazy. The OLD Zico deserved 5 stars. Not this. I hope those yoga places stop carrying it and tell Zico to bring back the fresh stuff. This sucks. I guess I better start mixing up these 35 bottles of zombie Zico with pomegranate juice or Acai Splash or something to cover up the taste and still benefit from the electrolytes. Hm.  I suspect there will be an upswing in sales for O.N.E. and VitaCoco and other brands in the old packaging. I've tried both of those (still have some ONE in the fridge from my order while I waited for Zico). Both were inferior to Old Zico. Both are preferable to New Zico.<br /><br />And someone please hand the president of Zico a bottle of this and ask hm if he REALLY thinks this is the taste of the stuff that made so many rabid fans, like I USED TO BE: past tense.<br /><br />Hey, Mr. Zico CEO, give me back my money!!!! You sold me rubbish!<br /><br />Okay, I ranted and got that off my chest. I do think having a recyclable bottle is great. The bottle feels good in the hand and makes it easy to add flavorings for those who prefer that. Easier to carry around. And I strongly suspect that those who are new to coconut water won't realize this has declined in flavor, so it's possible it can sell huge among the new initiates to the health benefits of coconut water.<br /><br />But I still miss old Zico.<br /><br />Note: I'm updating cause I found if I let the bottle sit with the cap off or  pour out into a glass, the funny smell dissipates and it's more drinkable. HTH.<br /><br />Update: Found a great replacement. Ordered Organic coconut water from amazon, brand Nature Factor. It's lovely. Lovely! So, at least I've found a happy replacement. Worth a try for those on the lookout for another tasty coconut water now that Zico sucks. Addendum: Found out that this brand uses very high heat to pasteurize and it may be nutrient compromised. If you mostly care about flavor, this one is great. If you are concerned about high heat, prolonged pasteurization, skip this one. HTH.<br /><br />2nd Update: I received a reply to an email I sent to Zico via their website. I was told that new Zico in the bottle tastes \"just like\" young Thai coconut water. That it's different from Brazilian c.w. and so takes getting used to. Hm. Well, I've had unprocessed/raw young Thai coconut water. I don't recall it making me wanna spit it out. :) Just sayin'.<br /><br />3rd Update: Saw a couple online taste tests that gave props to Amy & Brian, also available here on amazon,  so will be trying that, too, now that I'm coconut water peregrinating. Might be worth a shot to google up coconut water taste tests and see what might suit you if you aren't anti-can. ADDENDUM: Tried it, loved the first batch in the 17.5 oz cans. I emailed the company and it's just CW (not from concentrate) and it's FLASH Pasteurized, so the nutrient count should be comparable to other coconut waters in the tetra paks (though A&B will likely show a higher carb/calorie count due to its sweetness). If you're carb-counting, you may wanna compare. If your main concern is \"natural\" and tasty-sweet, then consider Amy & Brian's. Really nice. Warning: Ordered a second batch in the 10 oz cans, and it tasted odd. Candy-sweet, like candy that melted in water. So, I can no longer recommend this brand due to flavor inconsistencies on that scale. Pity, as my first order was AMAZING. boohoo<br /><br />4th Update: Old Zico from Brazilian coconuts will be back in September. If you liked old Zico, WAIT, don't buy this one. Also, in a letter from the Zico Sales Director to a reviewer here (see discussion for details), the Zico rep said they'd increased sodium in this bottled Asian CW Zico to \"optimize\" hydration benefits. So, it's not just that it's from concentrate, it's \"optimized\" to make it saltier. By optimized, I don't mean they ADDED sodium, but used a mix of coconuts to \"optimize.\" (Note: I know this cause the sales manager of Zico, Sherif P. Bates, replied to a discussion with a clarification, and this comment was posted under his own review post here. See discussion of comments under \"Todd O'Connor\". ) I don't know about y'all, but part of the reason why I like CW is that it's great to keep highish blood pressure normal due to its high Potassium. I do not need--and most Americans don't need--more sodium in their beverages or food. Maybe elite athletes sweating up a storm do, but not the rest of us who just exercise moderately (or not at all). So, there you go: New Zico. More sodium, less flavor.<br /><br />Note about reviews: Do check the reviewer's profile. If a reviewer is five-star (or four-star, even) raving about this product and has only reviews for Zico products and has no verified amazon purchase, find a grain of salt to toy with. That's no guarantee, naturally, but sometimes is a clue to...well, you can guess. (Note: See comments under the review by \"Todd O'Connor\" and under Alio \"Alio\"s review for an explanation of how I learned about ONE fake review and Alio \"Alio\" confirming the fake identity.)",

It tastes like coconut water from concentrate and I do not mean that in  a bad way.

Big mistake... unlike the product in the 11oz carton, this bottled stuff absolutely misrepresents authentic coconut water.  It has an after taste like sour milk.  I've tasted spoiled coconut water before in the caribbean, and even that tastes better than the new zico.  I have never felt so compelled to write a review about a product before.

    "review_text": "I've tried C2O, Vitacoco, and Naked coconut water. All of them contain one ingredient:100% natural coconut water. However, ZICO is the ONLY coconut water that is 1) Made from concentrate and 2) contains added \"Natural ingredients\". At trader joes, Zico costs about 2 bucks, which is the same price for C20 coconut water and Vitacoco which both do NOT have \"natural flavors\" added to it and are NOT from concentrate. The packaging advertises \"30 percent less sugar\"...well that's because they took out 30% of the coconut water and replaced it with water. It was so nasty that they had to add \"natural flavors\". Do not buy this brand. When I was a little kid I used to suck on my water squirt guns and the taste of this coconut water resembles that-like plastic/water with a small hint of coconut water. The other brands are so much better and are actually natural. For the same price, go get a coconut water that is not from concentrate. My favorite is C20.",

It tastes like coconut water to me with a slight extra taste of mango. Well, I'm not particularly interested in the mango taste, it's the ingredient mix in the water that is of interest. The mango taste just makes it a bit more tasty to someone who is not used to coconut water. And, except for the slight flavoring this is pure coconut water. Nothing else. I used to be a marathoner and we used to look for things like this. It's the mix of electrolytes that's important and this drink is impressive. It would be very good for relief of cramps and restoring lost body fluids when you pour out a lot of sweat. I wish I'd had it in my marathoning days.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",

    "review_text": "I was never a really big fan of ZICO natural before ... until the bottle came out. Honestly, I absolutely LOVE, LOVE the nuttier flavor and can't drink enough of it. It's significanlty more drinkable for someone who's never had coconut water a part of their daily diet.  The original flavors are great, Mango and Passion. I first fell in love with ZICO by drinking the Passion, then I started to wanting less flavor and transitioned to Mango. But never full latched onto natural. Though, I've been wanting to make the switch.<br /><br />With the bottle now, it's what I've been waiting for. I LOVE IT!!! It's amazing to just chug it cold after a hard work out, and you know it's packed with natural electrolytes, potassium, and so much more. Great for your skin and internal system. Overall it's just an amazing beverage. I can't stop raving about it to all my friends, family, and fellow athletes. Currently, I'm training for an aquathon, and I don't know how I did it before. But there's no going back now.<br /><br />My other favorite in the bottle is Lima Citron. It's so tasty. It just brings me back to my childhood since the smell reminds me of Fruit Loops! And it taste just as yummy, but sooo much better for you.<br /><br />Look I'll be honest. The bottle isn't tetra, and it's not meant to be. Tetra is great in it's own right, but this new line has proposed another fabulous alternative to all those who love coconut water but needed more versility with the on-go lifestyle. So credit is due for that.<br /><br />I'm super stoked that ZICO gave us consumers two options: tetra and bottle. And I'm going to enjoy both fully!! It's just wonderful to switch up the flavors. Somedays I'll have Natural others Mango. When I'm training, it'll be the bottle. At the office, it'll be the tetra. Any way you look at it, ZICO is helping me be healthier whether it's in the bottle or tetra.  It's just a personal preference at this point. So try it and be your own judge.<br /><br />Besides when I found out that the bottle is actually more environmentally friendly, I was happily surprised. Tetra isn't recylced by many plants nationally. 30% of the bottle is made from recylced materials and is 100% recylcable(including the cap - unlike water bottles). Personally, this is important to me.<br /><br />And I agree with the other reviewers with regards to the concentrate and the decrease of their carbon foot print. It's true and relevant.<br /><br />ZICO, thank you for the amazing products you continue to give to us, and most importantly thank you for promoting a healthier, more hydrated lifestyle in a fabulously tasty way via bottle or tetra. Here's to you in breaking the mold and trying to help more people with your new bottle while still keeping tetra for those who've become so loyal. Hat's off!!! You've now acquired another fan for life!!!<br /><br />Cheers!!!!<br /><br />P.S. ZICO is still amazing.",

That is, there was a compartmentalized container with the liter bottles carefully packed within, this box was surrounded by air bag packaging and packed within a larger sturdy cardboard container.  Great packaging.<br />  My wife uses this product and her comments follow:  As to the taste.  I found I prefer Zico over the other brands as it doesn't appear to have any \"hidden\" sugar added to hype up the taste.  My previous brand, Vita Coco,  did not declare added sugar, but it did leave that sugared drink after taste in my mouth and was noticeably sweeter.<br />  I cannot say that I particularly like the taste of coconut water, but it has the nutritional potassium I need in my diet, and is easier to keep around than bananas and has less calories.",

    "review_text": "This is a great product.  Although I'd initially planned to buy a single box to sample the product, I realized after reading previous reviews that coconut water was probably an acquired taste, so I bought a 12-pack just to see if I'd end up liking it.  At first, I was disappointed; the first taste seemed rather bland (and it was somewhat warm).  The next day, I drank another carton (cold now) and it wasn't too bad.  The third day I found myself looking forward to getting home to drink a carton of this stuff!  Now, I love it so much I've subscribed to regular deliveries.  For me, the mango flavor is the best.  I wish it were a little cheaper (thus only 4 stars) but otherwise I like the product just the way it is and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a lightly flavored alternative to sodas.",

He mentioned that it tasted different, but we didn't think much of it. Then, I noticed the \"from concentrate\" after looking at a bottle in the fridge. We are not paying \"top dollar\" for imitation coconut water and the explanation on their website was ridiculous. It is like can OJ! After doing my research on their website, I was angry that they switched the \"liquid\" going into the box vs. bottle. Never again! I immediately canceled our \"subscribe and save\" order.

    "review_title": "Bummer: My fave packaged coconut water is RUINED!",
    "review_text": "Note: Please carefully review the NEGATIVE reviews before purchasing, as a Zico sales manager and probably others have been affecting the ratings/reviews/comments here due to original Zico drinkers posting critical reviews about this inferior new product that's nowhere near as good as original Zico. Be forewarned.<br /><br />~I've been drinking Zico for a couple years, getting my fix via amazon subscription. I and my sisters loved this stuff so much, I used to regularly order my shipments EARLY, and multiple cases at that.<br /><br />Well, that's it. They have officially lost me as a customer. After waiting impatiently for them to be back in stock in the natural (I hate the flavored ones), I just got the three cases I ordered.<br /><br />Oh, my goodness. I have three cases of this horror! I can't drink this!<br /><br />I don't know why they had to mess with a successful and deliciously refreshing beverage. I grew up drinking fresh coconut water (my family hails from the Caribbean), so I am well accustomed to the natural and subtle yumminess of coconut water. A chilled Zico used to be as close as I could get to the treat that is sipping from a straw right out of the chilled coconut that's had it's top sliced open for you on the spot (and it gets harder to find that in Metro Miami, but you still can).<br /><br />Now, it's not fit to drink. It smells funny. It tastes strange. The best I can describe it is that it reminds me of a watered-down version of the remainder-milk at the bottom of a bowl of Corn Pops when I was a kid--less sweet, more watery, but like that, with a chemically edge and a stale smell.<br /><br />How messed up is this?<br /><br />I can't believe someone gave this bottled version 5 stars! That's crazy. The OLD Zico deserved 5 stars. Not this. I hope those yoga places stop carrying it and tell Zico to bring back the fresh stuff. This sucks. I guess I better start mixing up these 35 bottles of zombie Zico with pomegranate juice or Acai Splash or something to cover up the taste and still benefit from the electrolytes. Hm.  I suspect there will be an upswing in sales for O.N.E. and VitaCoco and other brands in the old packaging. I've tried both of those (still have some ONE in the fridge from my order while I waited for Zico). Both were inferior to Old Zico. Both are preferable to New Zico.<br /><br />And someone please hand the president of Zico a bottle of this and ask hm if he REALLY thinks this is the taste of the stuff that made so many rabid fans, like I USED TO BE: past tense.<br /><br />Hey, Mr. Zico CEO, give me back my money!!!! You sold me rubbish!<br /><br />Okay, I ranted and got that off my chest. I do think having a recyclable bottle is great. The bottle feels good in the hand and makes it easy to add flavorings for those who prefer that. Easier to carry around. And I strongly suspect that those who are new to coconut water won't realize this has declined in flavor, so it's possible it can sell huge among the new initiates to the health benefits of coconut water.<br /><br />But I still miss old Zico.<br /><br />Note: I'm updating cause I found if I let the bottle sit with the cap off or  pour out into a glass, the funny smell dissipates and it's more drinkable. HTH.<br /><br />Update: Found a great replacement. Ordered Organic coconut water from amazon, brand Nature Factor. It's lovely. Lovely! So, at least I've found a happy replacement. Worth a try for those on the lookout for another tasty coconut water now that Zico sucks. Addendum: Found out that this brand uses very high heat to pasteurize and it may be nutrient compromised. If you mostly care about flavor, this one is great. If you are concerned about high heat, prolonged pasteurization, skip this one. HTH.<br /><br />2nd Update: I received a reply to an email I sent to Zico via their website. I was told that new Zico in the bottle tastes \"just like\" young Thai coconut water. That it's different from Brazilian c.w. and so takes getting used to. Hm. Well, I've had unprocessed/raw young Thai coconut water. I don't recall it making me wanna spit it out. :) Just sayin'.<br /><br />3rd Update: Saw a couple online taste tests that gave props to Amy & Brian, also available here on amazon,  so will be trying that, too, now that I'm coconut water peregrinating. Might be worth a shot to google up coconut water taste tests and see what might suit you if you aren't anti-can. ADDENDUM: Tried it, loved the first batch in the 17.5 oz cans. I emailed the company and it's just CW (not from concentrate) and it's FLASH Pasteurized, so the nutrient count should be comparable to other coconut waters in the tetra paks (though A&B will likely show a higher carb/calorie count due to its sweetness). If you're carb-counting, you may wanna compare. If your main concern is \"natural\" and tasty-sweet, then consider Amy & Brian's. Really nice. Warning: Ordered a second batch in the 10 oz cans, and it tasted odd. Candy-sweet, like candy that melted in water. So, I can no longer recommend this brand due to flavor inconsistencies on that scale. Pity, as my first order was AMAZING. boohoo<br /><br />4th Update: Old Zico from Brazilian coconuts will be back in September. If you liked old Zico, WAIT, don't buy this one. Also, in a letter from the Zico Sales Director to a reviewer here (see discussion for details), the Zico rep said they'd increased sodium in this bottled Asian CW Zico to \"optimize\" hydration benefits. So, it's not just that it's from concentrate, it's \"optimized\" to make it saltier. By optimized, I don't mean they ADDED sodium, but used a mix of coconuts to \"optimize.\" (Note: I know this cause the sales manager of Zico, Sherif P. Bates, replied to a discussion with a clarification, and this comment was posted under his own review post here. See discussion of comments under \"Todd O'Connor\". ) I don't know about y'all, but part of the reason why I like CW is that it's great to keep highish blood pressure normal due to its high Potassium. I do not need--and most Americans don't need--more sodium in their beverages or food. Maybe elite athletes sweating up a storm do, but not the rest of us who just exercise moderately (or not at all). So, there you go: New Zico. More sodium, less flavor.<br /><br />Note about reviews: Do check the reviewer's profile. If a reviewer is five-star (or four-star, even) raving about this product and has only reviews for Zico products and has no verified amazon purchase, find a grain of salt to toy with. That's no guarantee, naturally, but sometimes is a clue to...well, you can guess. (Note: See comments under the review by \"Todd O'Connor\" and under Alio \"Alio\"s review for an explanation of how I learned about ONE fake review and Alio \"Alio\" confirming the fake identity.)",

I've tasted spoiled coconut water before in the caribbean, and even that tastes better than the new zico.  I have never felt so compelled to write a review about a product before.

However, ZICO is the ONLY coconut water that is 1) Made from concentrate and 2) contains added \"Natural ingredients\". At trader joes, Zico costs about 2 bucks, which is the same price for C20 coconut water and Vitacoco which both do NOT have \"natural flavors\" added to it and are NOT from concentrate. The packaging advertises \"30 percent less sugar\"...well that's because they took out 30% of the coconut water and replaced it with water. It was so nasty that they had to add \"natural flavors\". Do not buy this brand. When I was a little kid I used to suck on my water squirt guns and the taste of this coconut water resembles that-like plastic/water with a small hint of coconut water. The other brands are so much better and are actually natural. For the same price, go get a coconut water that is not from concentrate. My favorite is C20.",

It tastes like coconut water to me with a slight extra taste of mango. Well, I'm not particularly interested in the mango taste, it's the ingredient mix in the water that is of interest. The mango taste just makes it a bit more tasty to someone who is not used to coconut water. And, except for the slight flavoring this is pure coconut water. Nothing else. I used to be a marathoner and we used to look for things like this. It's the mix of electrolytes that's important and this drink is impressive. It would be very good for relief of cramps and restoring lost body fluids when you pour out a lot of sweat. I wish I'd had it in my marathoning days.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",

    "review_text": "I was never a really big fan of ZICO natural before ... until the bottle came out. Honestly, I absolutely LOVE, LOVE the nuttier flavor and can't drink enough of it. It's significanlty more drinkable for someone who's never had coconut water a part of their daily diet.  The original flavors are great, Mango and Passion. I first fell in love with ZICO by drinking the Passion, then I started to wanting less flavor and transitioned to Mango. But never full latched onto natural. Though, I've been wanting to make the switch.<br /><br />With the bottle now, it's what I've been waiting for. I LOVE IT!!! It's amazing to just chug it cold after a hard work out, and you know it's packed with natural electrolytes, potassium, and so much more. Great for your skin and internal system. Overall it's just an amazing beverage. I can't stop raving about it to all my friends, family, and fellow athletes. Currently, I'm training for an aquathon, and I don't know how I did it before. But there's no going back now.<br /><br />My other favorite in the bottle is Lima Citron. It's so tasty. It just brings me back to my childhood since the smell reminds me of Fruit Loops! And it taste just as yummy, but sooo much better for you.<br /><br />Look I'll be honest. The bottle isn't tetra, and it's not meant to be. Tetra is great in it's own right, but this new line has proposed another fabulous alternative to all those who love coconut water but needed more versility with the on-go lifestyle. So credit is due for that.<br /><br />I'm super stoked that ZICO gave us consumers two options: tetra and bottle. And I'm going to enjoy both fully!! It's just wonderful to switch up the flavors. Somedays I'll have Natural others Mango. When I'm training, it'll be the bottle. At the office, it'll be the tetra. Any way you look at it, ZICO is helping me be healthier whether it's in the bottle or tetra.  It's just a personal preference at this point. So try it and be your own judge.<br /><br />Besides when I found out that the bottle is actually more environmentally friendly, I was happily surprised. Tetra isn't recylced by many plants nationally. 30% of the bottle is made from recylced materials and is 100% recylcable(including the cap - unlike water bottles). Personally, this is important to me.<br /><br />And I agree with the other reviewers with regards to the concentrate and the decrease of their carbon foot print. It's true and relevant.<br /><br />ZICO, thank you for the amazing products you continue to give to us, and most importantly thank you for promoting a healthier, more hydrated lifestyle in a fabulously tasty way via bottle or tetra. Here's to you in breaking the mold and trying to help more people with your new bottle while still keeping tetra for those who've become so loyal. Hat's off!!! You've now acquired another fan for life!!!<br /><br />Cheers!!!!<br /><br />P.S. ZICO is still amazing.",

That is, there was a compartmentalized container with the liter bottles carefully packed within, this box was surrounded by air bag packaging and packed within a larger sturdy cardboard container.  Great packaging.<br />  My wife uses this product and her comments follow:  As to the taste.  I found I prefer Zico over the other brands as it doesn't appear to have any \"hidden\" sugar added to hype up the taste.  My previous brand, Vita Coco,  did not declare added sugar, but it did leave that sugared drink after taste in my mouth and was noticeably sweeter.<br />  I cannot say that I particularly like the taste of coconut water, but it has the nutritional potassium I need in my diet, and is easier to keep around than bananas and has less calories.",

Had to cancel my purchases from Amy and Brian due to so many cans being dented and mangled.",

It now comes from concentrate and does not taste as good or fresh as it once did.  It does not taste terrible by any means, but if you want fresh natural coconut water, Vita Coco is really the best.  I find the best way now to enjoy these now, is to add a bit of fresh lime juice to the bottle and shake it.  Unless Zico goes back to using fresh juice, I will not buy this product again.",

    "review_text": "This is a great product.  Although I'd initially planned to buy a single box to sample the product, I realized after reading previous reviews that coconut water was probably an acquired taste, so I bought a 12-pack just to see if I'd end up liking it.  At first, I was disappointed; the first taste seemed rather bland (and it was somewhat warm).  The next day, I drank another carton (cold now) and it wasn't too bad.  The third day I found myself looking forward to getting home to drink a carton of this stuff!  Now, I love it so much I've subscribed to regular deliveries.  For me, the mango flavor is the best.  I wish it were a little cheaper (thus only 4 stars) but otherwise I like the product just the way it is and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a lightly flavored alternative to sodas.",

I don't like the vending machine coffees at all - too chalky and gritty.<br /><br />Now on to my thoughts on this coffee - reminds me a lot of what I can get at Casey's - pretty sweet stuff. At Casey's gas station I usually get 2/3 cappuccino and 1/3 coffee. This isn't necessary to \"water-down\" with coffee. It is just right to me.",

Almost like hot chocolate if hot chocolate were made of coffee.<br /><br />The price was very good with subscribe and save and still shipped pretty fast, I think it even arrived within 2 days, though as I recall when one uses subscribe and save, in exchange for that extra discount one loses the free 2-day shipping. In any case, it arrived very quickly and the price was 11.xx I think for a 24 pack which is ok for Keurigs on Amazon. I usually expect to pay under 50 cents a cup for my favorite coffees, and this didn't disappoint.<br /><br />There's not much else I can say about this... the cups themselves seemed to require a little bit of a harder push than usual to puncture the bottom in the machine - the first time around it didn't puncture, but closing the top harder the second time worked. I've seen this issue before with a box I got from Sam's Club.",

No where did it say that it is instant or artificially lightened. I called the company and they said it did not have to be labeled \"instant\" coffee. I don't think he even wanted to listen to me.

As it brews, you get a real dark thick mixture of water and coffee, and then only water.  When it was done I opened the k-cup.  No coffee grounds, No filter, Nothing inside, completely empty.  The coffee is only for 8 oz. cups, any larger and it is watered down coffee.  Even at 8 oz., the coffee didn't taste good. (that's my personal opinion on the taste)  Overall:  You're getting low quality instant coffee at fresh brewed prices.  Shame on Grove Square.",

    "review_text": "I was so excited to see this product (Grove Square Hazelnut Cappuccino) for my beloved Keurig.  I usually brew flavored coffee into a mug of heated milk & a touch of sugar.  I thought this would be a step faster & a step up from my usual morning cup.  I was dismayed to read that the first ingredient is partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, but I figured I'd make the small nutritional sacrifice in the name of morning caffeine happiness.  Well, it turns out the taste is nothing like a true cappuccino, but almost identical to a convenience store (7/11) machine cappuccino.  If you love that flavor, you'll love this k-cup.  I thought those instant-flavored coffees were GREAT when I was a college student!)<br /><br />Another complaint about this new k-cup is that the box suggests you run a hot water cycle (sans k-cup) after making the cappuccino.  I presume this is to rinse out any dairy or sugar product which could muck up your machine.  I'm glad for the tip, but wish I didn't have to run down the water in my reservoir.<br /><br />I'd hate to throw this coffee out, so this morning I brewed a cup of this and then followed it with a plain coffee k-cup.  It isn't as sweet and has more \"real\" coffee in it, but it still tastes very artificial.  FYI: In addition to the artificial dairy & sweeteners, the cappuccino uses instant coffee.)",

I found Grove Square Cappuccino by accident.  I add some whipped cream on the top and what I end up with is a heavenly dessert that has none of the bitter taste of coffee.  I also bought the French Vanilla version and decided I liked it so much that I am on a monthly plan.  For anyone who loves flavored drinks this is perfect.  And my hubby finally came around and uses the Keurig for his coffee.  He does not use this drink since it does not have a coffee taste, thank goodness.<br /><br />I have been watching negatives and positives.  It is all a matter of preference and taste.  I happen to love this coffee because it is sweet and does not taste like coffee.  I simply hate coffee and this is a way to enjoy the Keurig and share some time with my husband who does drink coffee.  As for the additives... welcome to this world of the 21st century!  It satifies my sweet tooth and keeps me from eating cake, cookies, pie and ice cream.  So Grove Square bring it on.",

Almost like hot chocolate if hot chocolate were made of coffee.<br /><br />The price was very good with subscribe and save and still shipped pretty fast, I think it even arrived within 2 days, though as I recall when one uses subscribe and save, in exchange for that extra discount one loses the free 2-day shipping. In any case, it arrived very quickly and the price was 11.xx I think for a 24 pack which is ok for Keurigs on Amazon. I usually expect to pay under 50 cents a cup for my favorite coffees, and this didn't disappoint.<br /><br />There's not much else I can say about this... the cups themselves seemed to require a little bit of a harder push than usual to puncture the bottom in the machine - the first time around it didn't puncture, but closing the top harder the second time worked. I've seen this issue before with a box I got from Sam's Club.",

As it brews, you get a real dark thick mixture of water and coffee, and then only water.  When it was done I opened the k-cup.  No coffee grounds, No filter, Nothing inside, completely empty.  The coffee is only for 8 oz. cups, any larger and it is watered down coffee.  Even at 8 oz., the coffee didn't taste good. (that's my personal opinion on the taste)  Overall:  You're getting low quality instant coffee at fresh brewed prices.  Shame on Grove Square.",

I thought this would be a step faster & a step up from my usual morning cup.  I was dismayed to read that the first ingredient is partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, but I figured I'd make the small nutritional sacrifice in the name of morning caffeine happiness.  Well, it turns out the taste is nothing like a true cappuccino, but almost identical to a convenience store (7/11) machine cappuccino.  If you love that flavor, you'll love this k-cup.  I thought those instant-flavored coffees were GREAT when I was a college student!)<br /><br />Another complaint about this new k-cup is that the box suggests you run a hot water cycle (sans k-cup) after making the cappuccino.  I presume this is to rinse out any dairy or sugar product which could muck up your machine.  I'm glad for the tip, but wish I didn't have to run down the water in my reservoir.<br /><br />I'd hate to throw this coffee out, so this morning I brewed a cup of this and then followed it with a plain coffee k-cup.  It isn't as sweet and has more \"real\" coffee in it, but it still tastes very artificial.  FYI: In addition to the artificial dairy & sweeteners, the cappuccino uses instant coffee.)",

That was a bad idea.<br /><br />I'd buy it again in a lesser Qty, but 54 of these is going to last me a long time. They aren't bad at all, I just wasn't expecting such a sweet drink.",

I wasn't expecting a Starbucks Cap out of the K-Cup, but I was expecting a little more than this.<br /><br />I read the reviews and they were sort of mixed, so I chose to try it, but I won't buy these again. They will sit on the top cupboard shelf till i am desperate I guess or throw them away. Three boxes of them... EESSSH<br /><br />I also now realize these aren't eligible for return... so that sucks.

VERY comparable to the machine cappuccino, sweet, smooth, good flavor.  For under $10 a box it comes to around .40 a cup which is great compared to the $1.30+ at the store.

I didn't want to have to throw out that many Kcups if it was awful. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />We just started using our Keurig a few days ago so we're still testing out all of the good flavors. I've got this on my list of Kcups to stock up on in the future! The Grove Square Caramel Cappuccino is our second favorite flavor at the moment; our favorite is the Celestial Seasonings Sweet Southern Tea.<br /><br />Note: This cappuccino is very sweet. We love sweet drinks so this is great for us. I think it's perfect. However, if you don't like sweet drinks, you may not care for this.",

    "review_text": "I bought the Keurig for my husband who really did not want it.  I don't drink coffee but love, love gadgets.  So order to enjoy my new GADGET I had to find something to make.  I found Grove Square Cappuccino by accident.  I add some whipped cream on the top and what I end up with is a heavenly dessert that has none of the bitter taste of coffee.  I also bought the French Vanilla version and decided I liked it so much that I am on a monthly plan.  For anyone who loves flavored drinks this is perfect.  And my hubby finally came around and uses the Keurig for his coffee.  He does not use this drink since it does not have a coffee taste, thank goodness.<br /><br />I have been watching negatives and positives.  It is all a matter of preference and taste.  I happen to love this coffee because it is sweet and does not taste like coffee.  I simply hate coffee and this is a way to enjoy the Keurig and share some time with my husband who does drink coffee.  As for the additives... welcome to this world of the 21st century!  It satifies my sweet tooth and keeps me from eating cake, cookies, pie and ice cream.  So Grove Square bring it on.",

I don't like the vending machine coffees at all - too chalky and gritty.<br /><br />Now on to my thoughts on this coffee - reminds me a lot of what I can get at Casey's - pretty sweet stuff. At Casey's gas station I usually get 2/3 cappuccino and 1/3 coffee. This isn't necessary to \"water-down\" with coffee. It is just right to me.",

Almost like hot chocolate if hot chocolate were made of coffee.<br /><br />The price was very good with subscribe and save and still shipped pretty fast, I think it even arrived within 2 days, though as I recall when one uses subscribe and save, in exchange for that extra discount one loses the free 2-day shipping. In any case, it arrived very quickly and the price was 11.xx I think for a 24 pack which is ok for Keurigs on Amazon. I usually expect to pay under 50 cents a cup for my favorite coffees, and this didn't disappoint.<br /><br />There's not much else I can say about this... the cups themselves seemed to require a little bit of a harder push than usual to puncture the bottom in the machine - the first time around it didn't puncture, but closing the top harder the second time worked.

    "review_text": "This company is scamming everyone.  They put instant coffee in a k-cup and pass it off as real brewed coffee.  I purchased their Dark roast to try it out.<br />The first thing I noticed was how lite the k-cup felt.  If you shake it, it sounds like a little snarl drum.  As it brews, you get a real dark thick mixture of water and coffee, and then only water.  When it was done I opened the k-cup.  No coffee grounds, No filter, Nothing inside, completely empty.  The coffee is only for 8 oz. cups, any larger and it is watered down coffee.  Even at 8 oz., the coffee didn't taste good. (that's my personal opinion on the taste)  Overall:  You're getting low quality instant coffee at fresh brewed prices.  Shame on Grove Square.",

    "review_text": "I was so excited to see this product (Grove Square Hazelnut Cappuccino) for my beloved Keurig.  I usually brew flavored coffee into a mug of heated milk & a touch of sugar.  I thought this would be a step faster & a step up from my usual morning cup.  I was dismayed to read that the first ingredient is partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, but I figured I'd make the small nutritional sacrifice in the name of morning caffeine happiness.  Well, it turns out the taste is nothing like a true cappuccino, but almost identical to a convenience store (7/11) machine cappuccino.  If you love that flavor, you'll love this k-cup.  I thought those instant-flavored coffees were GREAT when I was a college student!)<br /><br />Another complaint about this new k-cup is that the box suggests you run a hot water cycle (sans k-cup) after making the cappuccino.  I presume this is to rinse out any dairy or sugar product which could muck up your machine.  I'm glad for the tip, but wish I didn't have to run down the water in my reservoir.<br /><br />I'd hate to throw this coffee out, so this morning I brewed a cup of this and then followed it with a plain coffee k-cup.  It isn't as sweet and has more \"real\" coffee in it, but it still tastes very artificial.  FYI: In addition to the artificial dairy & sweeteners, the cappuccino uses instant coffee.)",

I absolutely loved these, and after running out of the samples decided to order some from Amazon.<br /><br />For me, they were the perfect ammount of sweetness, and I didn't find there to be any weird artificial sweetner taste as some other reviwers have mentioned.<br /><br />Now I drink one of these every day. The only thing I prefer over these are the Caramel flavored ones (also from Grove Square).<br /><br />I would highly recommend these to everyone. Especially people who normally don't like coffee. A+ and 5 stars in my book!",

I also bought the French Vanilla version and decided I liked it so much that I am on a monthly plan.  For anyone who loves flavored drinks this is perfect.  And my hubby finally came around and uses the Keurig for his coffee.  He does not use this drink since it does not have a coffee taste, thank goodness.<br /><br />I have been watching negatives and positives.  It is all a matter of preference and taste.  I happen to love this coffee because it is sweet and does not taste like coffee.  I simply hate coffee and this is a way to enjoy the Keurig and share some time with my husband who does drink coffee.  As for the additives... welcome to this world of the 21st century!  It satifies my sweet tooth and keeps me from eating cake, cookies, pie and ice cream.  So Grove Square bring it on.",

I don't have anything against gas station coffee - in fact I drink a lot of it. I like the cappuccino that you can get at a Casey's. I don't like the vending machine coffees at all - too chalky and gritty.<br /><br />Now on to my thoughts on this coffee - reminds me a lot of what I can get at Casey's - pretty sweet stuff. At Casey's gas station I usually get 2/3 cappuccino and 1/3 coffee. This isn't necessary to \"water-down\" with coffee. It is just right to me.",

Almost like hot chocolate if hot chocolate were made of coffee.<br /><br />The price was very good with subscribe and save and still shipped pretty fast, I think it even arrived within 2 days, though as I recall when one uses subscribe and save, in exchange for that extra discount one loses the free 2-day shipping. In any case, it arrived very quickly and the price was 11.xx I think for a 24 pack which is ok for Keurigs on Amazon. I usually expect to pay under 50 cents a cup for my favorite coffees, and this didn't disappoint.<br /><br />There's not much else I can say about this... the cups themselves seemed to require a little bit of a harder push than usual to puncture the bottom in the machine - the first time around it didn't puncture, but closing the top harder the second time worked. I've seen this issue before with a box I got from Sam's Club.",

No where did it say that it is instant or artificially lightened. I called the company and they said it did not have to be labeled \"instant\" coffee. I don't think he even wanted to listen to me.

As it brews, you get a real dark thick mixture of water and coffee, and then only water.  When it was done I opened the k-cup.  No coffee grounds, No filter, Nothing inside, completely empty.  The coffee is only for 8 oz. cups, any larger and it is watered down coffee.  Even at 8 oz., the coffee didn't taste good. (that's my personal opinion on the taste)  Overall:  You're getting low quality instant coffee at fresh brewed prices.  Shame on Grove Square.",

    "review_text": "I was so excited to see this product (Grove Square Hazelnut Cappuccino) for my beloved Keurig.  I usually brew flavored coffee into a mug of heated milk & a touch of sugar.  I thought this would be a step faster & a step up from my usual morning cup.  I was dismayed to read that the first ingredient is partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, but I figured I'd make the small nutritional sacrifice in the name of morning caffeine happiness.  Well, it turns out the taste is nothing like a true cappuccino, but almost identical to a convenience store (7/11) machine cappuccino.  If you love that flavor, you'll love this k-cup.  I thought those instant-flavored coffees were GREAT when I was a college student!)<br /><br />Another complaint about this new k-cup is that the box suggests you run a hot water cycle (sans k-cup) after making the cappuccino.  I presume this is to rinse out any dairy or sugar product which could muck up your machine.  I'm glad for the tip, but wish I didn't have to run down the water in my reservoir.<br /><br />I'd hate to throw this coffee out, so this morning I brewed a cup of this and then followed it with a plain coffee k-cup.  It isn't as sweet and has more \"real\" coffee in it, but it still tastes very artificial.  FYI: In addition to the artificial dairy & sweeteners, the cappuccino uses instant coffee.)",

    "review_text": "I like coffee but I don't have a palate that can differentiate between a coffee with subtle hints of vanilla, grass and one with \"smokiness.\" I just know whether I like it or not. To me there's two kinds of coffee, the smooth kind and the kind that has a bite.<br /><br />I feel like Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts have a bite to them, something that makes them different. This Fog Chaser coffee is like that. There's something about it that makes it different and I think it's really good!<br /><br />The cups are not your normal K cup so I just got a metal tin and put them in there to keep them fresh.<br /><br />If you do the subscribe and save on amazon, it makes these cups very affordable (for k cups).<br /><br />Overall, very good coffee.",

I ordered the sfbay french roast, as was definitely intrigued. It had a bold taste, and the cups themselves got my attention. I wish the top cap wasn't plastic, but the pouch definitely allows for more of that coffee smell that I missed when moving to the keurig. I decided to try fog chaser out, it's fantastic. The flavor is wonderful, smells great while you're brewing, and we cut the tops off and easily compost the rest.

It is incredibly good, I don't think I want a cup of coffee and then I remember these are in the carousel for my Keurig machine, I change my mind in a heartbeat. It's like having a box of your favorite snack in the cupboard and trying to resist eating it, but you know it's there and you keep thinking about it.<br /><br />The flavor of this San Fransisco Bay coffee is rich, complex, and delicious. I can't think of a cup of coffee that I've bought anywhere that can beat the bold, rich flavor of this brand. It's like drinking a glass of fine wine. My favorite k-cup previous to this was Tulley's Kona Blend.<br /><br />The packaging of the individual coffee pod threw me off because when I opened the plastic bag with the pods in it, a very strong aroma of coffee filled the air. I wondered if the paper filter bottoms of the pods wouldn't let the coffee get stale, so I put them in a ziplock baggie. Time will tell I guess if the paper filter will allow the coffee to get stale or not. On the other hand I liked that there was a more green solution to the regular plastic coffee pod holder. I'm torn on this, I 'think' I'd rather have the pods be the more usual plastic in order to preserve freshness, but time will tell. I doubt any of the pods I have will have time to ever get stale however, because I'm drinking them all the time.",

    "review_text": "SF Bay Coffee's Fog Chaser was a nice \"bold\" surprise.  I am a big fan of Amazon's Subscribe & Save program and have been getting my K-cups this way for over a year.  Of course, once you find one you absolutely love (Timothy's World Midnight Magic), poof!  The Magic's gone!  Midnight Magic is still available on Amazon, though no longer offered through Subscribe & Save, and I refuse to pay $35 for 48 K-cups of any brand.  S & S now offers SF Bay Coffee's Fog Chaser and based on the quantity of favorable reviews, I decided to give it a shot.  The pods are far different than what we've all been used to, but they work like a charm, have less waste, and deliver a pretty bold, smooth cup of coffee.  My morning coffee always consists of two pods at the 6 oz. setting each for one eye-opening 12 oz. mug of coffee.  On that setting, Fog Chaser lives up to its name.  I have noticed some residue occasionally, but it certainly is minimal.  The pods come packed in plastic bags (12 pods/bag).  Once cut open, I just fold over the edge, clip it and store the bag in the fridge.  Strength is a personal decision, and to me, more than 6 oz. of water with ANY pod is too weak.  If you are a fan of Rev of Jet Fuel, this coffee is comparable.",

After I try the other flavors, I will use the subsription plan.<br /><br />After meeting my husband, I started drinking darker roast coffees, and this Fog Chaser was bold and delicious.  But the biggest reason why I tried this brand was because of the lack of the extra plastic.  I've felt bad about the excess plastic that was being discarded with K-cups.  I've bought a wide variety of gadgets that are compatible with Keurig, all in attempts to reduce waste.  Some had a re-usable cup with small inner paper filter, (which I still use when I acquire my own ground coffee) others were caps that went over re-used K-cups after they were emptied and rinsed.  But that all takes time that I don't always have.  I feel better that these have less waste PLUS they're less expensive than regular K-cups.  A subscription will make it that much cheaper.<br /><br />The box has separate bags of 8 coffee pods each.  I don't think maintaining freshness is an issue for me, since once I open up a bag, I simply put them in a sealed plastic container.  There is one plastic container included in the box, but it's a little on the flimsy side, certainly not Tupperware tough, but it's still enough to store these.  I drink one to two cups a day, so the opened bag doesn't have a chance to sit around long anyways.<br /><br />This fit perfectly in my Keurig machine, too.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this to others.",

    "review_text": "I decided to give these a try based on the price, the favorable reviews here on Amazon, and its sales rank in the K-cup store.  I was not disappointed as this is a strong, but not too strong, good-tasting coffee that not only tastes great but has a nice aroma.<br /><br />The pods are a little different than your traditional plastic K-cup portion as, instead of any plastic around the sides or bottom you have basically a mesh coffee filter holding the coffee grounds.  This appears to make a more complete brew, and allows more of the flavor to come into the actual coffee.  You will see a dirty residue at the bottom of your cup due to this filtration system vs. a \"clean\" look from a normal K-cup pod.  This seems to make sense as the normal K-cup pod has all of the brewed coffee escaping through the pinprick hole vs. the full brewing experience of these pods.<br /><br />As the pods are in this filtration medium the coffee is not air-tight sealed after you open the package of pods.  I have put the unused ones in a sealed Ziploc bag to keep them fresh.<br /><br />I also shared this with some folks in the office, who liked it so much they ordered their own so it's not just me who likes this stuff.  Who knows, I may have found a new favorite coffee!",

    "review_title": "finally coffee for my picky palate!",
    "review_text": "Recently I have become more and more choosy with my coffee. I own a Keurig one-cup brewer as well as a traditional coffee maker.<br />For years, I have been using the same coffee brand ( med or dark, middle-of-the road priced) and it was affordable and it tasted just fine. Lately, I was lacking depth and body when brewing in the keurig( I have the cup you can put your own coffee in, which saves resources and $). It seemed like I couldnt' pack enough flavor into the little chamber to really have the right strength. The pre-packed, ready to use K cups were much better, but at 3 cups/day for me not feasible in the long run.<br />I read the reviews of the San Francisco Bay coffee ( fog chaser) and the price appealed to me and also what customers had described, so I tried it. Besides the much more affordable price and far more \"green\" packaging, I find the flavor fantastic!<br />Bold, yet sophisticated, not just strong- really pleasant flavor ! A very good choice at an attractive price!. These cups look different, but I like them much better with their filter-like body and 12-count bagging. Now I don't feel guilty when I indulge with more than 1 K cup. For loose coffee to put into the reusable cup I choose a def. dark roast like italian or french, which is very comparable to the Fog chaser's aroma.",

The people who will like this, should know who they are, by my previous comment.

The flavor is full bodied and rich with a very smooth finish.<br /><br />Because I was familiar with Fog Chaser, I never even looked at the reviews before I made my purchase.  Therefore, I was rather surprised when I opened the box and saw the different type of pod.  With a filter bottom the pod seems much more environmentally friendly.  There was no residue at the bottom of my mug so the filter did a good job.  I agree with other reviewers of the need to keep these pods in a vacuum sealed container (or zip lock bag) but I think the use of less platics is a good thing.<br /><br />I have a B60 and these fit perfectly in the machine. I used the large cup setting and the strength of the coffee was perfect for my taste (I prefer stronger coffee).  Before purchasing Fog Chaser I was buying Jet Fuel.",

You just have to make sure the wrap is on taut so the needle pokes through. If its too loose the needle won't puncture and the water all spills over the top, Big Mess!  Good morning brew.

I'm so glad I decided to give it a try. Doing a side by side comparison, Fog Chaser wins hands down! If you like a bold cup that lingers on your tongue and hold up under creamer too (I use unsweetened coconut milk), you will be happy you tried this coffee. Oh! A huge added bonus of the new environmentally friendly K Cup design is that you get that heavenly coffee aroma from the minute you open the vacuum sealed bag! You don't have to wait until its brewing to \"wake up and smell the coffee!\" :)",

    "review_text": "Don't be alarmed when you receive these and they don't look like a standard K-cup. These are not K-cups, but dowill fit in your machine. I thought I had ordered the wrong product at first. These simply have a plastic ring at the top so that they'll fit in your K-cup holder and the rest of it is like a standard coffee filter. I've only tried Fog Chaser (ordered all 3 flavors) and was surprised that I liked the coffee. However, because it's using a filter rather than the K-cup technology, it does leave a sediment in the bottom of your cup. I find this also happens when using the My K-Cup filter with whatever brand of coffee I use.<br /><br />You will need to store the \"k-cups\" in a ziploc to keep them fresh. The 36-count come packaged in 3 plastic bags of 12 each. This is nice so that you only have to open up one 12 pack at a time so the others can stay fresh.<br /><br />I'm mostly neutral, but lean more toward \"would buy again\".",

The 36-count comes as 3 plastic bags of 12 cups. After opening the 1st bag, I'm keeping the remainder in the bag, sealed with a clip. It's possible that these could have freshness issues if left out for several days/weeks. I don't think my supply will last long enough to go bad though. I like the idea of less plastic - I like to compost my coffee grounds in the summer and these have much easier access to dumping out the grounds. (I can just tear open the mesh bag.) They fit in the Keurig and brew just fine.<br /><br />In fact, I usually buy the strongest coffee k-cups so I can \"double-brew\" mine into a bigger mug. True coffee aficionados may not prefer this. It may be too strong if you like lighter roasts or flavored coffees.<br /><br />Tastes great, cheaper and more environmentally friendly than other k-cups!",

    "review_text": "This is a first impressions review of the unique cup SF Bay uses in place of the traditional sealed K-cup design after using 12 cups.<br /><br />The cups work fine. They may take a few more seconds to brew (I haven't timed it) because the filter bag inflates with the hot water before the coffee comes out. This makes me think that the mesh bag is actually sealed somehow and that seal is broken with the pressure of the hot water as it's injected into the cup. A strong smell test indicates that there is some sort of seal there because there is not a strong coffee smell coming from the dry cups.<br /><br />If there is some sort of seal these cups should stay fresh longer than they would if the coffee was completely exposed to air. I am still storing these cups in the sealed 12 pack bags they came in and would recommend storing them in a sealed container if you don't go through them quickly. The need to store them sealed takes some convenience out of the K-cup system but the lower price of these cups should offset that.<br /><br />As for the coffee itself, it was good, strong, and tasted more like a fresh cup of coffee than any other k-cups I've tried. It could be the coffee or could be the cup itself. I plan to order a few different flavors in this cup style to find out.",

After all, given the wide disparity of opinion about which k-cup blend is bold, strong or rich in flavor, at least finding common ground with others who enjoy the aforementioned brands you can estimate the appeal of the flavor to your own palate.<br /><br />At the time I placed my order I didn't find any clear indicators from other reviewers along these lines, hence for what it's worth, as one who enjoys the previously mentioned k-cups, I can say that overall San Francisco Bay French Roast measures up pretty darn well to the more expensive brands.<br /><br />Now if cost were not a factor I'm not certain this would be my first choice as this blend has a somewhat smoky after taste and I prefer a more fruity or sweet flavor.

The only off putting problem I had was these are really sweet. I don't mean sweet potato sweet, I mean eating a salty sugar cube sweet. I checked and the carb count isn't bad, there are only 2 grams of sugar, but these have a weird sweet taste and a strange after taste.

You still get the crunchy feeling of a chip, but they are just \"different\" than a regular potato chip.<br /><br />As a huge fan of barbecue Popchips, I was very anxious to try the Chili Lime flavor.  After the first few chips I ate, I didn't think there was much kick to it.  However, it seems like the more you eat, the spicier they get.  I didn't neccesarily taste the lime in it.  I would personally prefer a little sweetness to the chili flavor, which it didn't have, so maybe that's where the lime falls in.  Overall, these chips have a lot of flavor and are decently spicy.  They are now my 2nd favorite Popchips flavor behind the barbecue.  So, if you like a little spice in your chips, definitely try the chili lime variety.",

    "review_text": "NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're \"probably\" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a \"tomato\" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like \"Tomato and Basil\" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now.",

Hard to explain since I don't know what to compare them too.

I love potato chips but they are loaded with lots of unhealthy things. I'm not saying these are healthy, just a lot less unhealthy than chips.<br /><br /> For starters these are all natural with very little fat and fairly low in carbs for a food of this type. My sugar is high but I feel comfortable eating these in moderation since the carbs are lower than chips.<br /><br />  I originally bought the variety pack so I could try them all, and I liked them all although somewhat partial to the Cheddar. It's just a matter of what mood I am in as to which one I'll choose.<br /> Unfortunately they are a bit pricy if you don't get them on sale. I just wish these came in a larger bag as opposed to the individual servings which are always more expensive.<br /><br /> Everyone has a different idea of good, so this is something you are going to have to try for yourself to decide.",

Of course I really enjoy rice cakes as well and these are similar in taste \"weight\" but the texture is more like maybe a thick (yet still light) Munchos, or maybe like a flattened out pork rind.  Like I said however, these are not for everyone.  My husband really doesn't like them much.  So far he only sort-of likes the Salt & Pepper.

Just the right balance of sweet and salty.  Portion controlled bags have only a 100 calories and 95 mg of sodium.  These are definitely a healthier alternative to potato chips.  But don't mistake \"healthier\" for \"healthy.\"  They have almost no nutritional value (1 g protein, 2% iron).  So don't let all the buzzwords on the packaging fool you.  Still, if you are looking for a light snack that won't ruin your diet, this is a good choice.  As an FYI, despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe, sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.  Rice flour is the first ingredient, followed by sweet potato flakes, tapioca starch, a blend of various oils, corn flour, seasonings, etc. Not a huge deal, but its one of those \"truth in advertising\" points that annoys me so I mention it.",

The flavor of the sweet potato is just right, mixed with a bit of saltiness - very tasty!  Just the right amount of light crunch, more like popcorn.<br /><br />At 100 calories per bag, these fit right into my eating plan that allows two 100-150 calorie snacks per day.  That made me extra happy!  There are plenty in the bag, too, unlike the small servings usually found in low-calorie snack packs.<br /><br />I shared these with a friend who came over one afternoon, since she also professed a love of sweet potatoes.  She asked for some extra to take home, she really enjoyed them.<br /><br />All the good Vitamin A content that you would normally find in a sweet potato has completely vanished in the processing of these, however.  I don't expect much from chips, I guess, still a bit disappointing.<br /><br />The bags are very thick, for a chip bag.  My 9 & 12 yr. old kids had trouble opening these, and resorted to scissors.  I should also mention that they are not fans of sweet potatoes, and did not care for these either.  That's ok - more for me!",

A couple others had reasonably nice flavor, BUT only had a couple small handfuls of popcorn in each bag so way overpriced and I definitely did not feel satisfied after 1 bag.<br /><br />Then I received the variety pack of PopChips.  I first tried the barbeque, which turned out to be my favorite.  They have nice strong bbq flavor, nice texture, and each bag has enough to feel satisfying.  The Original and Sour Cream and Onion came in lower second, but most of the others were just ok to fair- (not worth eating for my tastes but interesting).<br /><br />Best of all, the nutrition counts are good, with each bag only having 100 cals, 3 grams fat and 15g carbs (0 Cholesterol).<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product (and above flavors) over all the other popcorn types I tried.<br /><br />P.S.

One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.  The flavor isn't quite right, in my view.  My favorite flavor is barbecue followed by plain and the variety pack is a good way to figure out what you like the best.

    "review_text": "I've never been a big fan on chips. When it comes to snack foods, I'm more of a pretzel guy, or maybe something cheesy. Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these \"chips\" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's \"good\" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again.",

And I guess it has added vitamins and no calories, so it can make plain old water taste a lot sweeter as you're working out, giving you a bit of an energy and nutrient boost over the simpler water. My beef, and low star rating, is for the poor design of the bottle (at least the one I got as a sample). That thing was a hot mess. It didn't just squirt out a single stream where you want it; no that red dye stuff went ALL OVER the place in my kitchen, nearly staining my counters and cabinets. So I can't recommend this product because of the mess factor.",

It is important to shake the container well before dispensing to ensure everything is well mixed.<br /><br />This does have a good energy lift from caffeine and Vitamin B, and also has significant Vitamin C content (120% per serving). Since this is a good sized bottle at 12oz (24 servings), it is more convenient to keep on hand in the kitchen than the smaller Mio bottles (which are nice to carry on trips).<br /><br />A good choice for home use, mostly due to the large size.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH",

I liked that there was some nutritional content to the drink as well.  The design of the bottle is better and it's easy to figure out just how hard to squeeze to get the correct amount into your bottle or into your tea pitcher.  It's fruity enough and since I don't mine Splenda, the Sucralose in this product didn't bother me either.  It was not too sweet.  The price for the number of servings works out to be more reasonable than MIO because I find I have to use almost 4 times the recommended amount of Mio to acheive the same flavor.<br /><br />My only complaint, and it's a tiny one, was the first time I used it, I squeezed an awful lot into already caffeinated Tea and gave myself quite a ZAP!  I got a minor headache a few hours later.  Now I know to use this alone with water or with herbal tea.  It works totally fine that way for me.  If you too are careful about your servings of Cafeeine per day, be sure and count this into your daily intake to avoid withdrawal issues, ok?<br /><br />Overall, good price, good taste and nice design.  it could be a little better but I'd buy it on sale.  UPDATE 4/27/12:  I have gotten used to the caffeine in the product and bought another bottle on sale after getting used to adding this to my homebrewed iced tea.  Now I used it more to kick up the flavor in Herbal Iced teas due to the caffeine quotient.  I still prefer this packaging to MIO on every level.",

I usually drink bottled water and do not mind the `plain' taste.<br /><br />Sadly I can not read the ingredients on my bottle since it is covered with a sticker but the vitamin part seemed interesting. I have tried to add flavors to my water before but they have tasted artificial. I will say this does taste like fruit punch as it is listed. I was surprised at how flavorful it was and that it did not taste artificial like the other drinks I have tried. I found it rather refreshing and loved the flavor of it.<br /><br />The reason I would not buy it though is it is messy. I accidentally squeezed some out of the cup and it was so sticky. That was not the worse. I have cream colored counters and it leaked on them and it was less than 10 seconds of it sitting on the counter and figured a wet paper towel would wipe it up. Nope, it was already stained! I was shocked! I had to use one of those magic eraser pads to clean it off the counter. For how sticky and how easily it stains, it is not worth it to me.<br /><br />Taste wise it is there. However, if it stained that quickly, I wonder what it does to your body. I don't think I will be finishing it.<br /><br />Added after writing review: If I could give this a zero I would! I had the bottle near the computer to write the review. It has to be in the fridge after you open it. It was in the fridge with the cap down. I flipped it where the cap was on top thinking it would not leak this way taking it back to the fridge. Nope, the cap held the previous leftover squeeze and it leaked ALL over my cream rug and also my computer stand which is padded. I got rid of it. It is too messy and stains!",

I'm not an expert on how our bodies use vitamins or usable sources but in layman's terms it seems all right.<br /><br />I found it tolerable when I could squeeze the right amount but it's a bigger bottle and 1. a little unwieldy to cart around 2. hard to get any real measurement on. It is too easy to put too much or too little. I dislike tinkering - which is why I tend to favor the packets..I know exactly what the product tastes like and how to use it. No muss no fuss.

    "review_text": "I was looking forward to a water additive that actually provided energy too.  It's an internal struggle to avoid soda but I can't seem to give up caffeine in the mornings.  So enter vitamin squeeze, something that claims to give me energy and still be somewhat healthy, all making me drink water at the same time.<br /><br />I have to say, I didn't really get any energy kick from this drink.  It was like drinking regular water in that regard.  Sure there are some vitamins in there.  I was pleased to see that there was a lot of Vitamin C and Vitamin B's in there.  I don't really eat a lot of foods that contain those so it was a nice supplement.  And it was still 0 calories so you weren't adding much there either.  The rest of the ingredients I wasn't as fond of though.  The sweetener in this is Sucralose, and while I know there's a lot of controversy about the fake sugars, I'm just not a fan, and tend to avoid it when possible.  It has a strange aftertaste to me as well.  A lot of the other ingredients were the hard to pronounce type as well, and even though some of it was the vitamins, I like to see natural stuff in what I'm drinking.<br /><br />The taste was ok.  Kind of like watered down kool-aid, which I haven't had in forever.  So it made me feel a little like a kid again.  You're supposed to use one good squeeze per 8 oz of water.  But I find myself using twice that as I like a stronger flavor.  And as said before, it still tasted a little weak, although it did give the water a nice red color pretty quickly.<br /><br />One side note on the packaging.  It's easy to squeeze but I've been having trouble with it leaking around the cap.  I've tried tightening it to no avail, so I have to keep this drink packaging upside down.  Not a big deal at all, but if you don't and it does leak, it will stain any light surfaces around it.<br /><br />I wouldn't probably buy this again as I don't like the ingredients, but for someone who's not as concerned about such things, this may be a good drink additive.<br /><br />Review by M.

It touts itself as an \"energy drink\", but I honestly didn't feel any bump in energy when I used it.  It has about half the caffeine of a cup of coffee.  The fruit punch flavor is tolerable, but has a \"chemical\" after taste - it's difficult to get artificial fruit flavors right and this could use some work.  The artificial colors and flavors remove it from the \"healthy\" category.  \"Vitamin Squeeze\" also requires refrigeration after it's been opened which is a little inconvenient for me at work, but not necessarily a deal breaker.  The flavor isn't overly intense; one squeeze gives a hint of fruit punch flavor but if you like a stronger flavored beverage, a lot more than one squeeze will be needed.<br /><br />All in all, it's a passable water enhancer, but I wouldn't want to rely on it as a vitamin source or even as an energy drink.",

There's not really that much caffeine in this, so the effect overall is mild.<br /><br />However, that said, the two things that bother me about this product are the flavor and the use of Sucralose.<br /><br />The flavor is reminiscent of Vicks Cherry cough syrup, IMO. Not exactly refreshing and very artificial-tasting. What cherries and punch would taste like if they were made of out plastic.<br /><br />The use of Sucralose is a little disturbing for something that purports to be healthy. Why not use stevia, an all-natural sweetener instead? Zero calories and very sweet, but not man-made and you don't get these fun side affects(from Wikipedia): \"A Duke University study found evidence that doses of Splenda of between 100 and 1000 mg/kg, containing sucralose at 1.1 to 11 mg/kg (compare to the FDA Acceptable Daily Intake of 5 mg/kg), reduced the amount of good bacteria in the intestines of rats by up to 50%, increased the pH level in the intestines, contributed to increases in body weight, and affected the levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)\"  OK, I'm not a rat, but still, that is kind of a negative in my book.<br /><br />So, energy: 5 stars<br /><br />Flavor: Minus -.5 stars<br />Sucralose ingredient: -.5 stars",

Vitamin rich, it has a very pleasant taste that belies its sugar-free status.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to take the rating of this product down a notch for its packaging. It is extremely easy to dribble and leak if squeezed in the wrong manner, and the coloring is prone to staining. Also, the bottle size is larger than comparable drink products, such as Mio, meaning that it is not the most portable squeeze drink product around.<br /><br />In all, \"Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch, 12-Ounce\" is definitely worth picking up for its taste, which is pretty much the best I've had of its kind.

It's more a nutritional supplement than an energy drink.<br /><br />The flavor reminds me quite a bit of Tropical Punch Kool-Aid, mixed a little weak, and the chemical sweetener is balanced by the acidity to not be quite as strongly flavored as it can be in other water enhancers.

    "review_title": "Vitamin Squeeze Tastes Great When Added to Tonic Water and Ice!",
    "review_text": "Update on June 23, 2012:  I just discovered that Vitamin Squeeze tastes great when added to tonic water and ice.  (See the photograph that I have posted on this website.)  It reminds me of the fruit punch one drinks at a reception for a wedding, graduation, anniversary or other special event.  Tonic water costs about the same as bottled water.  Buy the generic brand.  Tonic water is carbonated water that is usually sweetened with fructose corn syrup, the same sweetener that is used in fruit drinks.  Vitamin Squeeze and tonic water is still healthier than sodas.  The brand of tonic water that I buy has 90 calories per serving.<br /><br />*******************************<br /><br />I suffer from chronic sinusitis; therefore, I shouldn't drink carbonated sodas because they increase my sinus congestion.  Another good reason why I shouldn't drink them is because I am prone to cavities.  However, I get tired of drinking only water.  Fortunately, my dentist recommended that I drink flavored water.  Normally, I use the MIO Liquid Water Enhancers.  My favorite flavor is the MIO Sweet Tea [<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4HUMY\">MIO Sweet Tea, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>].  It tastes like real ice tea whereas the other flavors remind me too much of the artificial, sugary-sweet Kool-Aid products I drank as a child [<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ50U4\">Kool-aid Tropical Punch Soft Drink Mix, 82.5-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 2)</a>].<br /><br />  I was excited to receive the Vitamin Squeeze Water Enhancer from the Amazon Vine Program.  I'm been using it faithfully for over a month.  First of all, it reminds me very much of the MIO products.  However, whereas the MIO products are more travel-size, the Vitamin Squeeze is more suitable for home use.  Vitamin Squeeze's larger 12 ounce size is more economical than MIO's 1.62 ounces.  I work at a shipyard where the water tastes foul.  I usually bring my own drinking water into the office.  I purchase various sizes of Deer Park water as shown in the photograph I've posted on this website.  Before I leave home for work, I squirt three drops of the Vitamin Squeeze into the 500 ml bottle or five drops into the 750 ml one.  The fruit punch flavor is a pleasant respite; however, when my bottle of Vitamin Squeeze is empty, I plan on buying the peach green tea flavor [<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006MONQP4\">Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Peach Green Tea, 12-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>].<br /><br />  Unlike soft drinks, a serving of Vitamin Squeeze has 120% RDA of Vitamin C.  (A serving size equals one squeeze per eight ounces of water.)  Vitamin C is a natural antibiotic that boosts your immune system and helps ward off flus and colds and fight infections, such as a sinus infection.  Each serving also has 40 mg of caffeine which is about equal to that of a soft drink.  However, instant coffee has 65 to 100 mg of caffeine per eight ounce serving; brewed coffee has 80 to 135 mg; and Starbucks Grande Coffee (16 oz) has a hefty 330 mg.  The Vitamin Squeeze has Vitamins B6, B5, B3 and B12 (40% RDA of each), which give you energy.  Honestly, I haven't noticed any difference in my energy levels since drinking this product.  If you want to increase your energy level, the best thing you can do is get more sleep at night.  There are also zinc and chromium (10% RDA), which also boost your immune system.  Like Gatorade, the Vitamin Squeeze also contains electrolytes which aid in recuperation after exercising, especially jogging.<br /><br />  I store my Vitamin Squeeze in my refrigerator in order to maintain freshness.  The first couple of weeks I noticed red stains on the bottom of the refrigerator shelf.  However, using a soapy sponge, I was able to easily wipe them away.  The bottle is comfortable to grip while quickly squirting drops into the Deer Park containers.  I cap the bottles and shake them and the water enhancer is easily dispersed throughout the water.  There is not a horrible aftertaste.  I am reminded of the Kool-Aid I drunk as a child.  Nevertheless, the Vitamin Squeeze is a healthier, more economical alternative to soft drinks.  It is good to use in large bottles of water that you plan to take to work, church or the gym.  Bottled water always comes in handy when I'm walking through my apartment complex or rehearsing in choir.  (I've also sipped on water that was enhanced with Vitamin Squeeze while I relaxed in a bubble bath.)  It is wise to keep a bottle of Vitamin Squeeze at home and at work.  For traveling to restaurants, church, social gatherings, etc., then I recommend the smaller MIO products; they fit easier inside one's purse or backpack.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos",

From Mio, to Nuun, to Crystal Light, and the store brands, I've tried most of them.  This one sounded pretty interesting.  Upon receiving the bottle, I stuck it in my bag to take to work.  When I went to use it for the first time, I looked at the back to see how much to use.  I was quite surprised to find it needed to be refrigerated after opening.  Back home it went, where it could be refrigerated.<br /><br />I find the flavor to be good.  You can actually taste the pineapple, and maybe some banana (although there's not banana in the picture.)  Like most of these things, getting the mix can be tricky.  After a few attempts, I've figured it out.  I think I'm using more than the squirt per 8oz, but that's ok.<br /><br />I don't usually feel caffeine (unless I drink a lot) so I can't really tell if this would affect a normal person.  The price seems high, but I don't really know how much you get from 12 oz of mix, compared to a box of pre-measured powders.  If a squirt is half an ounce, this is about twice as expensive as Crystal Light.  Of course the fact that it needs refrigeration may imply that it's a little more real than its competition.<br /><br />It's good enough that I might try the other flavors.",

    "review_title": "Not bad but not great",
    "review_text": "This is a great idea - water flavoring with no calories!  It helps you drink more water, and since almost no one drinks enough water, that's a good thing!<br /><br />But...<br /><br />There is nothing on the packaging saying you have to check the opening where the drink comes out.  Mine wasn't open, apparently (yes - I unscrewed the cap and took off the protective cover first) and nothing came out when I squeezed.  I squeezed harder, and red liquid came out from all over, including under the threading of the cap. Some got into my glass, luckily.<br /><br />After cleaning the counter, my shirt, and the bottle, I tasted my water.  Not bad.  Fruit punch is not my favorite flavor, but this was definitely tasty and didn't have a diet aftertaste.  I hadn't put enough in my cup, so very carefully (and in the sink) I squirted again.  It works fine now - yay!<br /><br />The fact that you're supposed to refrigerate after opening makes a certain other water enhancing drink (I hate those commercials, but their product is pretty good) much easier to take to work.  My purse isn't refrigerated, so I'll probably finish this up at home.  This product does have vitamin C and various vitamin Bs, so it's got that going for it, but since it's really not as user friendly as it should be, I think I'll get my vitamins somewhere else.",

    "review_title": "It's Okay",
    "review_text": "This product claims to add two things to water: flavor and an energy boost.<br /><br />The flavor is pretty good, sweet but not too sweet, like a punch made from all-natural juices.  Getting it just right is difficult, though, because of the inexact science of mixing it with the right amount of water.  The bottle says \"one squeeze per eight ounces,\" but a squeeze can be very short or very long, so it's hard to know how much to use.  The bottle says it contains 24 squeezes, but unless you want to measure 1/24th of the bottle with a measuring spoon or mix the whole bottle in with a gallon and a half of water right away and draw from that supply, that's no help.  I tended to err on the side of more rather than less; underestimating the squeeze produced a pretty watery flavor.<br /><br />As for energy, it didn't do much for me.  When it first came in the mail I immediately poured a glass of water and mixed it in while sitting around.  At that point I thought I felt a little energy boost; but when I would drink it during a workout, I found it was no more revitalizing than plain water.<br /><br />So call it two and a half stars: four stars for the flavor, one for the (lack of) energy boost.",

    "review_title": "An \"ok\" energy drink",
    "review_text": "This product, the \"Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch\", offers a calorie free way to turn your water into a fruit-punch tasting energy drink.  One squeeze of the bottle will flavor 8 ounces of water.  Below are my impressions of this product:<br /><br />- It's hard to tell how much \"one squeeze\" is.  For my first glass, I gave the bottle a large squeeze, and discovered that I had put way too much flavoring in.  There are markings on the side of the bottle that show how much liquid would equate to one squeeze, but it's not transparent and you can't see the fluid level inside the bottle.  Through trial and error, I managed to work out how much of a squeeze flavored my water to the level I wanted it, though.<br />- It indeed tastes like fruit punch, but there is an aftertaste.  Given that it's artificially sweetened and fortified with vitamins, I expected that there would be.  It's about the same level of aftertaste as you might get from a glass of artificially sweetened kool-aid.  Not overpowering, but noticeable.<br />- I like that it's fortified with vitamins; while this might not be the best way to get them (eating nutritious foods is), every little bit helps!<br />- If you like energy drinks, this is an efficient way to store them.  One 12 ounce bottle effectively replaces 24 8 ounce cans.  All you need to do is add a \"squeeze\" to a glass or bottle of water.<br /><br />Overall, \"Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink\" gives you a shot of caffeine and some important vitamins per serving and is concentrated so that it won't take up a lot of room in your fridge.  But the taste to me is just ok.  And that's how I rate this drink: \"ok\", which in my scoring system is three stars.",

    "review_title": "Is this a health drink or a kids drink?",
    "review_text": "If people bought \"energy\" drinks solely on the basis of taste, the market for these products would shrink pretty quickly because most of these drinks have no definable taste profile and mostly taste like diluted Kook-aid. Fortunately for companies like the aptly named Vitamin Squeeze, buyers have been so conditioned by the giant beverage companies (e.g., Gatorade, Coke, Pepsi, etc.) to accept gawdawful concoctions falsely marketed as \"flavors\" that what the product actually tastes like is of little or no concern when the purchase decision is made.<br /><br />It's hard to tell what the makers of \"Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink\" want you to think of their product. The product description suggests this is an energy/vitamin drink that will enhance your health. The packaging and flavor descriptions (e.g., \"fruit punch\") suggest this stuff is a kids' drink along the lines of Kool-aid injected with a jolt of caffiene.<br /><br />I tried to ignore the marketing buzzwords completely and focus on the taste and the convenience factor. In terms of taste, if you ignore the flavor listed on the label, you'll have a tough time describing what this product actually tastes like. It's definitely not fruit, and it doesn't taste like any punch I'd consume. I'd say it tastes kind of sweet and mostly artificial. It's drinkable, as long as your expectations are very low and you're OK with a drink that is red and sweet and not much more.<br /><br />The packaging is pretty cool, though, and portioning is easy - which is why a product like this exists. Just fill an empty bottle with water, squeeze in a little concentrate, shake, and you've got a cheap energy drink in seconds.<br /><br />If Vitamin Squeeze can produce a drink that tastes like something grown, not manufactured, I'd have this stuff stacked to the ceiling in my pantry. Until then, I'll pass.",

I use a little less than the recommended amount to suit my taste. I haven't noticed any real energy boost though. I'll stick to coffee if I need a caffeine jolt. As for the vitamins its infused with, I guess they can't hurt, but don't confuse Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink as something healthy. It's a zero calorie, zero carb beverage, that is sweetened with Sucralose. They also added some caffeine and vitamins, but it's probably more for marketing than anything else.

    "review_title": "Just a mess all the way around.",
    "review_text": "I love energy drinks. This one is kind of a mess in every way. First, it leaks,or at least mine did. It leaked when I 'squirted' it into the glass (from the cap itself, not the intended spount within the cap) and it stained my towel I used to clean it up with. Then it leaked when I turned it upright, so I tried storing it in the fridge and it leaked either way. Blah! It could have been just this bottle, but I only have this bottle to review :)<br /><br />Typically, most 'one squirt is enough to make 8 oz' bottles tend to give the same amount at every 'one squirt'. Well, this one is very much like a bottle of dish soap, one squirt could really go on a long time and you could squeeze the bottle while squirting and practically empty it. In short, I don't think the measurement part is any good at all.<br /><br />The flavor is just okay. I would compare it with most name brand fruity kids' drinks, with a hint of chemical flavoring. Yum, right? Not really. As I mentioned, I really enjoy energy drinks with Taurine etc and this was nothing like them, much more like fruit juices that don't contain actual juice.<br /><br />Lastly, I tried this on my day off. I made my drink kind of strong because I tasted it as I went and wanted it to be less watery flavored. An hour later, I took a nap. No problem. No energy, not even the awake feeling I get with a cup of coffee.<br /><br />All in all, this is not the drink for me and I can't see myself buying it for any reason.",

I don't think this is a bad thing, as our taste buds are conditioned for overly sweet drinks.<br /><br />The one thing I would warn against is that one of the main ingredients in this drink is sucralose (Splenda). So, if you are against the myriad of artificial sweeteners on the market today, this drink is definitely not for you.",

The flavoring was fine for me, tasted like fruit punch but not overwhelming - although I did add more than you probably should!  I don't know that I necessarily felt an energy bust but it definitely was better than plain water. It does have to be refrigerated which is nice because it adds for a colder drink but it is also not portable though.

    "review_title": "Best tasting stuff yet",
    "review_text": "I really prefer this to Mio.  It puts a little splash of flavor into your drink, and it has some essential vitamins to boot, to include Electrolytes (it's what plants crave), 10 mg taurine, 10 mg caffeine, 40% each of B1, B5, B6, and B12, and 120% Vitamin C.  NO SUGAR!  I got this stuff mainly for the ENERGY component - i've been working long hours and am not a big fan of coffee, and soda in the morning just doesn't taste the same.  This is a great alternative, tastes sort of like Kool-Aid without the 2 cups of sugar.  However, I don't find the Energy boost to be very substantial.  It has slightly less caffeine per serving than the average soda, and about half the caffeine than a cup of coffee.  I would not rely on this as an energy boost, unless maybe you were to squeeze in 5 servings into a bottle of water.<br /><br />As an added benefit, I also use this stuff in water to give to my kid when they ask for juice.  She really likes it, and can't tell the difference.  I have always had sensitive/weak teeth, so I try to keep sugars out of her diet as much as I can, so the fact that I can give her juice without her knowing it is a great thing, plus it's easy to transport and give to her on-the-go.  All you need is a water bottle and the Vitamin Squeeze!  Plus, I don't find any more fermented apple juice sippy cups in the back of my car anymore!<br /><br />MY ONLY ISSUE with this product (hence the 4-star review) is the function of the bottle.  It seems clean and easy, but the design is flawed.  The bottle is designed to be stored upside-down.  The problem is that the nozzle leaks.  When the cap is closed, no product will come out, so it's not like it will seep out of its container altogether; however, when inverted, the gravity causes small amounts of product to ooze out of the nozzle and into the cap.  Then, when you open the cap, that oozed product drips out (because you have it inverted) and lands on your floor or counter.  Well, the first time this happened, i got some on my hardwood floor and my cheap, laminate countertop.  The dog cleaned the stuff from the floor, and I was too lazy to wipe the stuff off the counter.  Later on, when I tried to clean it off the counter, I found that no amount of cleaner or scrubbing would completely remove the red splotch from the surface.  I spilled it again in a different spot, and cleaned it up immediately.  There is still a visible splotch, but it's not red in color.  I don't know why this stuff stains so quickly and so well, but it's a problem.  It's easily fixed by storing the bottle upright.<br /><br />If anyone has any suggestions on a homemade concoction that will take out a red stain from a countertop, please let me know.  Maybe I can get Ecosentials, LLC (the maker of this product) get buy me new countertops?",

    "review_text": "This was my first time to try \"Vitamin Squeeze\" brand water enhancer, although I am very familiar with the similar Mio brand that's been on the market for quite a while.  Even though I knew that this container would be 12-ounces, I was still amazed when I opened the box to discover how truly large this bottle was compared to Mio water enhancer.  The Vitamin Squeeze bottle is about three times larger than a Mio bottle, although it actually holds 12-ounces as opposed to Mio's 1.6-ounce.  But please note that they actually offer the exact same number of servings (24).  Mio is concentrated, while Vitamin Squeeze is not -- as was clearly stated on the package.  As far as taste, quality, and appearance was concerned, I don't think the lack of concentration made any difference.  It's also worth noting that Vitamin Squeeze should be kept in the fridge, unlike Mio which I store in my pantry.  This might be a serious issue for those interested in carrying a bottle around in a purse or gym bag, in addition to its unwieldy size.<br /><br />I received one bottle of the Fruit Punch flavor to try out, and I decided to compare it directly with the Mio version of Fruit Punch to provide a more accurate review.  Mio's punch is a bright, rich -- almost unnatural -- red, like Kool Aid, and it tastes like it too.  Vitamin Squeeze delivers a more subtle pink-orange colored beverage, and the taste is very different.  It is not overly sweet, like Mio.  In fact, my first impression was that it tasted more like the fruit punch flavor of Gatorade I drank years ago when I was in high school.  I tried the Vitamin Squeeze at different times of the day.  It was not a very pleasant drink first thing in the morning, though it was actually quite refreshing -- more so than the sticky sweetness of Mio -- after a morning workout.  I tried to drink it with a meal but quickly gave up.  I'd rather enjoy water or soda.  This \"fruit punch\" stands on its own and didn't see to go well with food of any kind.  Finally, I let my four-year-old daughter try it for the ultimate test.  She's a big fan of Mio, which she calls \"magic fruit punch,\" and often uses it at dinner to flavor her water.  She disliked Vitamin Squeeze and would only drink one sip, which she dismissed as unsweet and yucky.<br /><br />My conclusion is that, while Mio's Kool Aid-type punch is great for kids, Vitamin Squeeze is probably a better choice for active adults, especially since it does provide a few vitamins (nothing much beyond your typical 100% Vitamin C) and tastes great and not too sweet after a workout.  The 12-ounce bottle is a bit clunky, needs to be stored in the frige, and you really have to squeeze a couple of generous full-bottle squirts into your water bottle to get a real taste of the product.  I have my doubts that my bottle will make it all the way to a full 24 servings, and I stopped keeping track after about six or so.  Given the choice, I think I would choose Vitamin Squeeze over Mio.",

    "review_text": "Tired of drinking the same bland, clear bottle of water every day at work or school?<br /><br />Looking for a source of Vitamin C and natural Caffeine with no calories or bitter coffee taste?<br /><br />If you answered yes to any of these questions, then Vitamin Squeeze Water Enhancer is a product you should try out soon.  Over the past few weeks, I have managed to empty an entire bottle of this product and wanted to share my experiences in this review.<br /><br />First, using Vitamin Squeeze Water Enhancer Fruit Punch flavor is very easy.  Just remove the top plastic, protective wrapping, unscrew the cap and take off the foil based seal.  Replace the cap and squirt 1/2 ounce into your cup of water.  The Water Enhancer seems to quickly dissolve in water and gives it a deep pink color.<br /><br />The Taste Of Enhanced Fruit Punch Water<br />Enhancing the flavor of pure water, is a simple thing to do.  Yet, Vitality Avitae Caffeinated Water has proven to me that you can mess it up real bad.  They made the mistake of adding no flavoring to mask the chemical taste of caffeine.<br /><br />With this product, we are told it has a fruit punch flavor and I heartily agree.  The fruit punch flavor hits your tongue and stays there.  In my opinion, it is mildly sweet but not overpowering in anyway.  You can increase the strength of the flavor by adding more Vitamin Squeeze but it can get to be rather strong.  Of course, you will also use up your little squeeze bottle faster as well.  Try not to apply this product in a cup with ice cubes because they will tend to keep it from dissolving into the rest of your water.<br /><br />Keep An Eye On The Serving Size!<br />My preferred water cup is a Tervis 24 ounce Big T Clear Tumbler with a McNeese State University logo inside.  The recommended serving size for Vitamin Squeeze Fruit Punch is half an ounce per 8 ounces of water.<br /><br />Maximize The Life Of Your Water Enhancer By Refrigerating It!<br />The energy and vitamin ingredients in this flavorful product should be preserved to maintain their peak effectiveness.<br /><br />In conclusion, after using Vitamin Squeeze Fruit Punch Flavor for four days, my energy levels have increased and my stamina has improved as well.  Could it be a side effect of drinking less sugar and more pure healthy water?  You be the judge!",

    "review_text": "First, you have to gnaw your way through the \"certified frustration free packaging,\" I recommend a steak knife.  Second, you squeeze one dose into eight ounces of water.  Stir and hold you nose as you drink.  Ok, you don't actually have to hold your nose, but the super sweet flavor will go down a bit easier that way.  Finally, wait for the energy to kick in.  Myself, I tried this four days ago, and I'm still waiting.  Pure gimmick, nothing else.  I'm sure it's all full of vitamins as it says, but it certainly isn't full of energy.<br /><br />On the plus side, it has zero calories, sugar, and carbs, so it won't make you fat as you sit there listlessly.  I also have to say that the squeeze dispenser is pretty cool, and there is no mess afterwards.  Nevertheless, I mixed it into 12 ounces of water, and I could barely swallow the thick, syrupy mixture.  The flavor is overwhelming, and nowhere near pleasant.  Give this one a pass.",

I am not a big fan of plain water, and it's portability would make it nice for taking to playdates, picnics, etc. So as soon as I got the bottle, I tried it out. I was terribly disappointed.<br /><br />There are a couple of issues I have with this. The first is that the bottle just instructs you to squeeze - no amount is listed, and you can squeeze a crazy amount at one time. I realize this is so people can make it to their own taste, but a baseline would be nice.<br /><br />By far the worst part of this energy drink is the after-taste. I couldn't even finish my glass the two times I tried it. I figured maybe I just needed to adjust the flavor after the first time, so I waited a few days and then used less in the cup. The initial flavor wasn't bad (watered-down fruit punch, basically), but the after-taste was nasty. I can't even bring myself to drink any more.<br /><br />I think I will be sticking with other tried-and-true water additives.",

    "review_text": "In truth, I'm not a big fan of these squeeze bottle water flavorings. Often, I find it hard to control the quantity, and under-flavoring makes the drink taste like a flat soda, whereas over flavoring is just too sweet. This larger bottle, however, seems to give just the right amount of flavor if you use two fingers to squeeze until it becomes too hard to squeeze anymore, and the spout seals tight and effectively to prevent drips and spills. The overall flavor is your typical fruit punch-y flavor, and there is only that faintest hint of chemicals to suggest the caffeine, taurine and vitamins it contains. The pick-up it provides is mild, I'd say about the same as a cup of coffee or can of diet soda. I don't think the other stuff in it is particularly strong or useful to my body as far as recovery times, strength building, electrolyte supply, etc. Still, I use this as my flavoring of choice on rest and light workout days, with <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003X5FYJQ\">Optimum Nutrition Essential Amino Energy, Fruit Fusion, 30-Count</a> my \"go to\" drink on workout and hard running days.

    "review_text": "I was excited to try this because I drink mostly flavored water and I work overnight. I am always in needed of caffeine. I liked the fact that Vitamin Squeeze would help me get in my daily dose of Vitamin's. Unfortunately, Vitamin Squeeze was a huge let down. First of all, it says that you only need one squeeze. I tried what I determined a squeeze to be and my water verily tasted flavored. I added the proper amount (about 5-8 squeezes) to get the coloring of what a fruit punch flavored drink should look like.<br /><br />The Vitamin Squeeze tasted like watered down, but sugary Kool-aid. I actually liked the flavor and continued to drink it. I definitely felt a slight energy increase. It was not enough to make you buzzed, but enough to notice a difference. My biggest problem then came when it was time to take the Vitamin Squeeze home (I first tried it at work). The lid was completely closed and it LEAKED everywhere! On top of that, the red dye in Vitamin Squeeze stained my hand and my desk. I was able to get the stains out, but not happy with the crappy container that this product comes in. I also do not like that fact that IT HAS TO BE REFRIGERATED and you have to shake well before each use. For me, this takes away a lot of the convenience factor. I want something I can take with me places.<br /><br />PROS:<br />*Makes water taste better<br />*You get a larger container for your money<br />*Contains Vitamins and Electrolytes<br />*Sugar, Carb and Calorie free<br /><br />CONS:<br />*You have to add more than you do with similar drinks<br />*It has to be Refrigerated<br />*You have to shake well before using<br />*Has a slight after-taste<br />*You have to limit intake due to Vitamins (too much is bad for you too) and caffeine<br />*The bottle is not secure<br />*It stains<br /><br />Overall, this product has more Cons than Pros.

I don't know if it's necessarily high in caffeine (since it's hard to judge how much actually goes into a glass of water), but I definitely felt it.  It may be the combination of the caffeine and Vitamin C.  To me, it falls somewhere between drinking a Red Bull (not too strong) to Monster (very strong).

The taste of the drink is pretty good and doesn't taste like liquid vitamins, which normally have a metallic taste.  It is much better if you make sure your water has ice in it. I found that if I put 2 squirts or perhaps 3 into an 8 ounce glass, the taste improved and became richer in flavor. The problem with this is that you're adding more caffeine to the drink, which I realized at midnight when I still couldn't sleep several hours after drinking this. The lack of precise measurement is a bit frustrating too. The instructions say \"just a squirt\", but the bottle doesn't stop the flow of concentrate and you could literally empty the bottle in one squeeze. I wish the bottle required an additional squeeze for each additional portion but it does not. Overall, I like the idea of adding vitamins to my diet, and the flavor of the drink is quite good.

I ran across this while looking at the Mio products and thought it was cheaper while also containing vitamins so I'll give it a try first. I have been pleasantly surprised by how good it tastes. It has a little bit of a vitamin'y taste (cant think of a better way to describe it) but not bad at all. You can meter however much you want into your water so your tastes may be different than mine. All in all the taste is very close to Hawaiian Punch. I don't get the same energy buzz I got from ZipFizz but it does give you a small kick to help you out. This costs ~$0.20 a shot for me, I take about 2 full shots in my water bottle and I'm done.<br /><br />I think I've found my new favorite water enhancer and only wish I had the option of \"Subscribe and Save\" so I don't have to worry about running out.",

The product is designed to turn water into a more flavorful beverage.  It is cleverly designed so that one squeeze of the bottle injects just the right amount of enhancer to flavor an 8-ounce glass of water.<br /><br />The fruit punch flavor is extremely sweet, so I'd suggest adding a half squeeze first to see how it tastes before committing to a full squeeze.  The liquid is fortified with Vitamin C, four B vitamins, natural caffeine, and electrolytes.  The caffeine is intended to give you the same shot that coffee or cola provides.<br /><br />For those who are trying to wean themselves from soda or calorie-rich fruit juices, Vitamin Squeeze is an alternative worth investigating.  The 12-ounce container has enough liquid for 24 servings.  You can eke out more servings if you don't want too sweet a drink.<br /><br />Be careful opening the container.  It has an inner seal.  If you don't remove it VERY carefully, you'll spill some of the liquid and it is VERY sticky.  Take your time, and open it over the sink.  Don't risk staining a tablecloth.<br /><br />I'm a longtime fan of diet soda, so I would not abandon diet soda for this beverage.  I like carbonation, and this drink has none.

The main point that these started with was being a mix concentrate in a \"SMALL\" squeeze bottle that is \"easy to carry with you\" and use anyplace anywhere. They decided not to make this one as concentrated so it needs to be a much larger bottle. And even though it is a large bottle of mix, it still only holds enough for 24 servings. The same as the little bottle that MIO uses. It says on the bottle to use one squirt for every 8oz. of water. But it's really hard to tell when to stop squeezing the thing. I think what ever it is in the bottle that measures how much to release at one time in my bottle is broken. It's really hard to tell just how much to use and it doesn't seem to really have much true Fruit Punch \"flavor\" to it. It sure doesn't taste like any fruit punch I've ever had. It reminds me a lot of the old artificially sweetened Kool-Aid that they came out with a long time ago and used Saccharin in.

    "review_text": "Water \"enhancers\", or \"energy\" drinks are all the rage now. So this new one by the stand alone company of Vitamin Squeeze, is entering a crowded market. Claiming to be an all natural flavored product, the list of ingredients on the bottle is pretty long (longer than the ingredients listed on both Amazon and the companies webpage). Vitamins A, B3, B5, B6, B12, and C have been \"added\", along with Taurine, Magnesium, electrolytes, and caffeine. Each serving squeeze flavors an 8 oz glass of water, and there are 24 servings in a bottle (or perhaps not - see below).<br /><br />To put this enhancer in perspective, a typical 1oz serving of espresso packs a punch of 40 to 75 mg of caffeine; 40 mg is what this water enhancer provides in an 8 oz glass. The added benefit with the squeeze is that you don't have to add calories via cream and sugar, and you've got a few vitamins thrown in as well. Another plus, is the convenience of simply squeezing in the flavor and caffeine.<br /><br />However, taste wise, the fruit punch tastes like sugar free gum. So yes, it's got that weird phony aftertaste that makes you screw up your face after drinking it. Another problem comes from the squeeze method per serving. One full squeeze delivers much more than is recommended, so each bottle comes no where near 24 servings.<br /><br />All and all, I'm going to stick to coffee and tea for my caffeine, and truly natural juices for my vitamins.",

    "review_text": "I like water additives as an alternative to sodas or sugary drinks, so I was excited about trying this one.  I thought it would be one that my 9-year old son and I could both use. The mix has a sweet fruit punch flavor if you follow the recommended dilution, but getting that squeeze just right is sometimes tricky. Although it seemed like a good idea to have a large bottle that you could adjust flavor levels and for a reasonably good cost.  It is just harder to execute in actuality than in design.  My son would squeeze to much and we went through a cycle of add a little more water then a little more mix...<br /><br />My biggest complaint and the reason I wouldn't use this product regularly is for the caffeine content. I generally use water additives as an alternative to sodas or other beverages and thus look for caffeine-free alternatives.<br /><br />OK, but I won't be a repeat user.",

    "review_title": "More Like Vitamin Squeeze Enemy",
    "review_text": "I had read a few of the reviews on Vitamin Squeeze Fruit Punch flavored water enhancer before I first tried it.  I noticed a couple said it was on the sweet side.  My experience seems different than most of the reviewers, so I am not sure if I got a \"bad bottle\" or what<br />One serving is ½ ounce squeezed into 8 ounces of water.  The bottle is 12 ounces so you should get about 24 servings.<br /><br />Ingredient-wise, one serving of the  Fruit Punch flavor (1/2 ounce) has some vitamins in it, primarily Vitamin C (120% of the RDA), followed by 40% RDA of B3, B5, B6, and B12.  It also advertised 10% RDA of Chromium and Zinc., but it's also got 40mg of caffeine serving, so less than a Red Bull but more than some other drinks, including some sodas.<br /><br />I've tried this product with a good squeeze into an 8 ounce glass of water and more than one squeeze in a larger glass (about 12 ounces).  It tastes weak to me. .  I have used \"water enhancers\" before, usually with good results in both use and flavor.  I also think I've mastered squeezing things from a bottle, so I'm assuming I was \"operating\" it correctly!  I do not like things overly sweet, so I don't think its my taste being off.<br /><br />I've tried it a few times, shaking the bottle before squeezing, trying \"a little more\", a little less water......it's very weak, sort of like if you took a few teaspoons of a fruit juice and mixed it in water.  I found the only way it offers any taste of any sort is to use a very loooong squeeze of it into an 8 ounce glass of water.  I can only describe it as tasting like a severely watered down Kool-Aid or Hawaiian Punch.<br /><br />I actually tried putting it into the glass before the water, just to see how much I was using in order to get some taste.  I found I was using far more than the  ½ ounce.<br /><br />I also ran into an issue with the bottle itself.  The drink was leaking from where the bottle meets the screw on cap.  I checked it several times to ensure it was screwed on properly.  There is what appears to be a (cardboard? foam?)  \"washer\" in the cap.  I made sure it was seated, to no avail.  Removing it didn't help either.<br /><br />The leak presented a major drawback as it time I used the bottle I ended up with red dye on my hand, and/or counter, floor, in the fridge, etc.  I ended up having to discard it before it was empty due to the mess it was making.<br /><br />So, again, I am not sure if I got a bad bottle, but I hope I did, because otherwise this stuff is awful.  I do want to note again that many of the product's reviews are good, so my experience may be isolated, but going by the bottle I used, I'd steer clear of this product.",

    "review_text": "I picked up the Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink to take to work and give a boost to my water consumption. Who couldn't use a bit more vitamin C or energy? While there is some nutritional value in the vitamin content, the drink is also loaded with artificial ingredients. The caffeine content, alone, seems counterintuitive to something that wants to market itself as healthful. So, I'm not sure that Vitamin Squeeze has exactly figured out which niche in the marketplace it wants to fulfill. Health or energy? By making claims to both, it also falls short of either.<br /><br />The one thing I did like is that the bottle is much bigger than other water additives (heck, the waste of plastic and processing on those tiny bottles drives me insane). The instructions say that you add a squeeze to 8 ounces of water. That would make 24 servings in the bottle supposedly. One problem, a squeeze isn't a real unit of measurement. With too little, there is no taste at all and if you use enough to notice--you'll probably only end up with 8-10 servings. The taste, even with extra squeezing, is like diluted sugar free kool-aid. It's not awful, but it has a pronounced aftertaste. If you're looking for a caffeine supplement, you might find this appealing enough. But it's not something that I would revisit for either the vitamins or the caffeine. KGHarris, 6/12.",

It has 0 calories and give the water a sweet, artificial fruity taste that look like a popular red punch drink.

It has vitamin C, B6, B5, Zink, B3, B12, magnesium and chromium and 40 mg of caffeine. The bottle is a size that I can keep in the small fridge at work. It is suggested to finish it within 30 days. The squeeze once feature doesn't seem to work on my bottle. I was putting it in a glass of water (16 oz?) and it hadn't stopped coming out when I had more than enough. From now on I will just measure or use less. I'm not a huge fan of sucralose, but I'm only planning on 1 or less servings a day, so won't worry about this. In conclusion, I like it for what it is and will consider purchasing it again for a change of taste with a pick-me up.",

It tasted better than most fruit drinks!  It has a load of vitamins and taste great and has nothing bad in it (calories, fat or sugar)!

I added less to see if I could tolerate it in small doses.  The results were all the same...the taste is just yuck.

Maxwell House crowd perhaps.  I prefer coffee with more depth and complexity, i.e. Starbucks, and Jet Fuel misses that mark by a wide margin.<br /><br />My favorite K Cups so far have been Donut Shop, Kona, and Caribou Blend.

    "review_text": "I was searching for the perfect K-Cup to make lattes at home. I wanted one that tasted the most like coffee shop espresso. Jet Fuel is the hands-down winner! It's rich, bold and slightly bitter, which is perfect for lattes. I brew it on the smallest setting so that it is more concentrated. I heat milk with flavored creamer and pour it into the Jet Fuel. Then I whip it with my little hand-held frother. It tastes as good as, if not better than, a coffee shop latte at less than half the price! So wonderful! I would not drink Jet Fuel straight, but it is the perfect choice for lattes.",

    "review_text": "My box has an expiration date of September 13, 2012, which is a little bit less than 2 months (which is okay, because the cookies get eaten up fast!). The cookies, made with whole grain Quaker oats, are definitely soft baked, and you can taste the delicious oatmeal in every bite! My only criticism of these cookies is that even though they had raisins, I couldn't taste them! It was practically just an oatmeal taste.<br /><br />Each cookie's size is a bit larger the palm of an adult hand. I love that they are individually wrapped because it means I can take them on the go with me! Each cookie is 170 calories, has 1.5 gram of fat, 150mg of sodium, and 12gram of sugar. I don't recommend the cookies for warding off hunger if you are on a diet as the calories per cookie is pretty high. This is good as treats for children's lunches though or to have them in your car when ever you go hungry.<br /><br />Also, I dropped one of the cookies (still in the wrapper) on the floor and it did not crumble, which I was happy with.",

(Of course, it's hard to eat just the one when there are two in the package so you'd have to share.)<br /><br />I know that it's hard to find time to bake from scratch sometimes but the effort to do so, teaching a child how to measure and mix a recipe from scratch, to then enjoy something that the two (or three or four) of you made together, is invaluable.  Make a double batch and freeze the dough before baking and you wouldn't have to do this every week to have enough cookies to last entire month or longer.  You'll build bonding moments, create less waste, teach simple mathematics and cooking skills, and provide a far healthier snack option for your child(ren).<br /><br />And if you truly don't have the time to bake cookies, then buy some fresh fruit.  If nothing else, you'll have fewer additives and most fruit comes in it's own convenient packaging.",

Having tried these and shared them with some co-workers I can honestly say that it's not just me that wasn't impressed.  There wasn't much said that was positive.  For being a soft baked cookie it tasted awfully dry.  It was almost more like a cereal bar rather than a cookie.  There was no yummy buttery taste.  They just weren't worth the 170 cals per cookie.  The only thing positive that was said is that it is convienient to have them separately packed for lunches and on the go snacks.",

They're about as big as you'd imagine it to be from the picture on the box, which is actually impressive given how often cookies end up being smaller than they appear.

The only off putting problem I had was these are really sweet. I don't mean sweet potato sweet, I mean eating a salty sugar cube sweet. I checked and the carb count isn't bad, there are only 2 grams of sugar, but these have a weird sweet taste and a strange after taste.

You still get the crunchy feeling of a chip, but they are just \"different\" than a regular potato chip.<br /><br />As a huge fan of barbecue Popchips, I was very anxious to try the Chili Lime flavor.  After the first few chips I ate, I didn't think there was much kick to it.  However, it seems like the more you eat, the spicier they get.  I didn't neccesarily taste the lime in it.  I would personally prefer a little sweetness to the chili flavor, which it didn't have, so maybe that's where the lime falls in.  Overall, these chips have a lot of flavor and are decently spicy.  They are now my 2nd favorite Popchips flavor behind the barbecue.  So, if you like a little spice in your chips, definitely try the chili lime variety.",

    "review_text": "NOTE: This review is for the Chili and Lime Flavor Popchip.  Amazon had a separate page for it but then merged the product and its reviews into one.<br /><br />It's hard to objectively review food since everyone's palate and tastes are different.  So what I can say about this particular Popchip flavor that should be useful for most folks out there is that it doesn't really taste like Chili and Lime you're \"probably\" expecting.  The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a \"tomato\" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like \"Tomato and Basil\" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now.",

    "review_text": "Hey!!  these things taste good. At first I thought they would be like Pringles,\" which I don't care for \" but they are not. Hard to explain since I don't know what to compare them too. I guess I would call them light and fluffy and yet nice and crisp with a great natural flavor.<br /><br /> These have taken some of the guilt out of eating this type of snack for me. I love potato chips but they are loaded with lots of unhealthy things. I'm not saying these are healthy, just a lot less unhealthy than chips.<br /><br /> For starters these are all natural with very little fat and fairly low in carbs for a food of this type. My sugar is high but I feel comfortable eating these in moderation since the carbs are lower than chips.<br /><br />  I originally bought the variety pack so I could try them all, and I liked them all although somewhat partial to the Cheddar. It's just a matter of what mood I am in as to which one I'll choose.<br /> Unfortunately they are a bit pricy if you don't get them on sale. I just wish these came in a larger bag as opposed to the individual servings which are always more expensive.<br /><br /> Everyone has a different idea of good, so this is something you are going to have to try for yourself to decide.",

So far, I have tried the plain (really don't like these - no flavor at all), BBQ (very nice, rather sweet - I do like these) and Salt & Pepper (by FAR my favorite).  The Salt & Pepper are VERY peppery.  More Pepper than Salt, but I really enjoy the savory bite these have.  I really enjoy the texture of these as well.  Of course I really enjoy rice cakes as well and these are similar in taste \"weight\" but the texture is more like maybe a thick (yet still light) Munchos, or maybe like a flattened out pork rind.  Like I said however, these are not for everyone.  My husband really doesn't like them much.  So far he only sort-of likes the Salt & Pepper.  I would suggest going on PopChips website and see where they are sold locally, around me they are sold at Target Stores.",

Just the right balance of sweet and salty.  Portion controlled bags have only a 100 calories and 95 mg of sodium.  These are definitely a healthier alternative to potato chips.  But don't mistake \"healthier\" for \"healthy.\"  They have almost no nutritional value (1 g protein, 2% iron).  So don't let all the buzzwords on the packaging fool you.  Still, if you are looking for a light snack that won't ruin your diet, this is a good choice.  As an FYI, despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe, sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.  Rice flour is the first ingredient, followed by sweet potato flakes, tapioca starch, a blend of various oils, corn flour, seasonings, etc. Not a huge deal, but its one of those \"truth in advertising\" points that annoys me so I mention it.",

The flavor of the sweet potato is just right, mixed with a bit of saltiness - very tasty!  Just the right amount of light crunch, more like popcorn.<br /><br />At 100 calories per bag, these fit right into my eating plan that allows two 100-150 calorie snacks per day.  That made me extra happy!  There are plenty in the bag, too, unlike the small servings usually found in low-calorie snack packs.<br /><br />I shared these with a friend who came over one afternoon, since she also professed a love of sweet potatoes.  She asked for some extra to take home, she really enjoyed them.<br /><br />All the good Vitamin A content that you would normally find in a sweet potato has completely vanished in the processing of these, however.  I don't expect much from chips, I guess, still a bit disappointing.<br /><br />The bags are very thick, for a chip bag.  My 9 & 12 yr. old kids had trouble opening these, and resorted to scissors.  I should also mention that they are not fans of sweet potatoes, and did not care for these either.  That's ok - more for me!",

A couple others had reasonably nice flavor, BUT only had a couple small handfuls of popcorn in each bag so way overpriced and I definitely did not feel satisfied after 1 bag.<br /><br />Then I received the variety pack of PopChips.  I first tried the barbeque, which turned out to be my favorite.  They have nice strong bbq flavor, nice texture, and each bag has enough to feel satisfying.  The Original and Sour Cream and Onion came in lower second, but most of the others were just ok to fair- (not worth eating for my tastes but interesting).<br /><br />Best of all, the nutrition counts are good, with each bag only having 100 cals, 3 grams fat and 15g carbs (0 Cholesterol).<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product (and above flavors) over all the other popcorn types I tried.<br /><br />P.S.  PopCorners White Cheddar brand came in SECOND.  Nice crunchy texture and pleasant cheddar flavor",

I have kept 40 pounds off for 2 years, and these Popchips have been my go to snack; in fact I EAT THEM EVERY DAY!!  They fill my craving for salty chips for very few calories.  One small bag does it for me.  I like the original, but the other flavors are also good!  Without these, I may have had to eat regular chips and had difficulty keeping my weight off.

    "review_text": "As I write this review, I'm looking at 3 large boxes of Popchips stacked in my living room.  I bought 2 of the 3 boxes, which each contain 24 bags of the chips.  One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.  The flavor isn't quite right, in my view.  My favorite flavor is barbecue followed by plain and the variety pack is a good way to figure out what you like the best.

    "review_text": "I've never been a big fan on chips. When it comes to snack foods, I'm more of a pretzel guy, or maybe something cheesy. Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these \"chips\" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's \"good\" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again.",

    "review_text": "In general, I love Popchips.  (BBQ are my absolute favs.)  These are the chips I go for automatically at the store because of their crisp texture and great taste.<br /><br />This review is for the Chili Lime Popchips.<br /><br />They have a little heat for the Chili and a bit of acid for the Lime, however, I must admit that these are not my favorite.  The taste took some getting used to and, while not awful, this is not a flavor I'll be going back to.  The chips have the same great Popchip texture however, they left a bit of an unpleasant after taste coating the back of my throat.  An after taste that lasted quite a while.<br /><br />Since everyone loves different flavors, I'm sure there will be folks that will love these, but for me, the Chili Lime flavor rated a 3.  Not awful.  Not great.  Not on my shopping list.",

That might be a bit fanciful, but that's how it feels when I bite into one.

The only off putting problem I had was these are really sweet. I don't mean sweet potato sweet, I mean eating a salty sugar cube sweet. I checked and the carb count isn't bad, there are only 2 grams of sugar, but these have a weird sweet taste and a strange after taste. If you like the sweet salty trend, the salted caramel or bacon sweets, you'll probably really like these, I prefer a more savory crunchy snack.",

You still get the crunchy feeling of a chip, but they are just \"different\" than a regular potato chip.<br /><br />As a huge fan of barbecue Popchips, I was very anxious to try the Chili Lime flavor.  After the first few chips I ate, I didn't think there was much kick to it.  However, it seems like the more you eat, the spicier they get.  I didn't neccesarily taste the lime in it.  I would personally prefer a little sweetness to the chili flavor, which it didn't have, so maybe that's where the lime falls in.  Overall, these chips have a lot of flavor and are decently spicy.  They are now my 2nd favorite Popchips flavor behind the barbecue.  So, if you like a little spice in your chips, definitely try the chili lime variety.",

The Chili and Lime most folks probably are expecting if they grew up on Frito Lay products is very sharp and sweet (and of course artificial) - but it's what we liked if we ate more than a bag.<br /><br />The best way I can describe this flavor is that it has a \"tomato\" like taste to it with a somewhat tangy sour note that is suppose to be the lime component.  Together they turn into an odd combination that registers other flavors in your mind than Chili and Lime - at least it did to me and others who tasted it with me.  If you eat the skin of a green bell pepper, you can kind of get at what Popchips were trying to do with the Chili taste on this version, but I have no idea how some sour salt can be akin to lime.  For myself personally, I thought it tasted like \"Tomato and Basil\" you would find on Pita chip flavors and baked snacks.<br /><br />Whether or not you agree with my above description of the flavor, I would highly suggest you try to get this in a sample pack and try it out first.  BBQ + Salt & Vinegar Popchips are still my staples for now.",

They don't taste like a traditional chip they seem infused with air or something.

Hard to explain since I don't know what to compare them too. I guess I would call them light and fluffy and yet nice and crisp with a great natural flavor.<br /><br /> These have taken some of the guilt out of eating this type of snack for me. I love potato chips but they are loaded with lots of unhealthy things. I'm not saying these are healthy, just a lot less unhealthy than chips.<br /><br /> For starters these are all natural with very little fat and fairly low in carbs for a food of this type. My sugar is high but I feel comfortable eating these in moderation since the carbs are lower than chips.<br /><br />  I originally bought the variety pack so I could try them all, and I liked them all although somewhat partial to the Cheddar. It's just a matter of what mood I am in as to which one I'll choose.<br /> Unfortunately they are a bit pricy if you don't get them on sale. I just wish these came in a larger bag as opposed to the individual servings which are always more expensive.<br /><br /> Everyone has a different idea of good, so this is something you are going to have to try for yourself to decide.",

The Salt & Pepper are VERY peppery.  More Pepper than Salt, but I really enjoy the savory bite these have.  I really enjoy the texture of these as well.  Of course I really enjoy rice cakes as well and these are similar in taste \"weight\" but the texture is more like maybe a thick (yet still light) Munchos, or maybe like a flattened out pork rind.  Like I said however, these are not for everyone.  My husband really doesn't like them much.  So far he only sort-of likes the Salt & Pepper.

Just the right balance of sweet and salty.  Portion controlled bags have only a 100 calories and 95 mg of sodium.  These are definitely a healthier alternative to potato chips.  But don't mistake \"healthier\" for \"healthy.\"  They have almost no nutritional value (1 g protein, 2% iron).  So don't let all the buzzwords on the packaging fool you.  Still, if you are looking for a light snack that won't ruin your diet, this is a good choice.  As an FYI, despite what the marketing and package language would lead you to believe, sweet potato is not the main ingredient here.  Rice flour is the first ingredient, followed by sweet potato flakes, tapioca starch, a blend of various oils, corn flour, seasonings, etc. Not a huge deal, but its one of those \"truth in advertising\" points that annoys me so I mention it.",

The flavor of the sweet potato is just right, mixed with a bit of saltiness - very tasty!  Just the right amount of light crunch, more like popcorn.<br /><br />At 100 calories per bag, these fit right into my eating plan that allows two 100-150 calorie snacks per day.  That made me extra happy!  There are plenty in the bag, too, unlike the small servings usually found in low-calorie snack packs.<br /><br />I shared these with a friend who came over one afternoon, since she also professed a love of sweet potatoes.  She asked for some extra to take home, she really enjoyed them.<br /><br />All the good Vitamin A content that you would normally find in a sweet potato has completely vanished in the processing of these, however.  I don't expect much from chips, I guess, still a bit disappointing.<br /><br />The bags are very thick, for a chip bag.  My 9 & 12 yr. old kids had trouble opening these, and resorted to scissors.  I should also mention that they are not fans of sweet potatoes, and did not care for these either.  That's ok - more for me!",

A couple others had reasonably nice flavor, BUT only had a couple small handfuls of popcorn in each bag so way overpriced and I definitely did not feel satisfied after 1 bag.<br /><br />Then I received the variety pack of PopChips.  I first tried the barbeque, which turned out to be my favorite.  They have nice strong bbq flavor, nice texture, and each bag has enough to feel satisfying.  The Original and Sour Cream and Onion came in lower second, but most of the others were just ok to fair- (not worth eating for my tastes but interesting).<br /><br />Best of all, the nutrition counts are good, with each bag only having 100 cals, 3 grams fat and 15g carbs (0 Cholesterol).<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product (and above flavors) over all the other popcorn types I tried.<br /><br />P.S.

    "review_text": "I love potato chips.  I could eat them by the bagful but thanks to the powers that be, this would not provide anyone with enough nutrition to survive.  Nonetheless I have eaten my share of potato chips over the years, and perhaps as a result I have been watching my weight lately.  I discovered these great popchips and they hit the spot in a number of ways.  First they are a low-calorie alternative to regular potato chips, meaning I can eat a normal-sized portion and still keep on target with my weight loss goals.  Second, they are gluten-free, which is great for those of us who have gluten intolerance issues.  Third, they taste great - light and airy, crispy, rich in that great potato flavor that keeps me reaching for another one.  This is a great product and I hope it stays around for a good long time.",

One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.  The flavor isn't quite right, in my view.  My favorite flavor is barbecue followed by plain and the variety pack is a good way to figure out what you like the best.  But I cannot recommend Chili Lime Popchips.",

    "review_text": "I've never been a big fan on chips. When it comes to snack foods, I'm more of a pretzel guy, or maybe something cheesy. Potato chips, in particular, just never appealed to me. But these aren't potato chips.<br /><br />If you read the bag, and I'm one of those strange people that actually do read the bag, you'll find out that these \"chips\" are not chips at all. They are neither fried, nor baked; they are made similar to how cheese-puffs are made, only in a way that results in a chip-like product, rather than a puff. This gives them a really addictive, crunching texture that keeps me going back for more. They pack a pretty good Sweet Potato flavor, with a noticeable sweetness balanced by saltiness and what I think are some subtle notes of spices like cinnamon. They're really tasty.<br /><br />While I wouldn't exactly call this health food, it's certainly not as bad as many traditional snack foods. Each individual bag is a serving and contains about 19 chips. The caloric price tag is 100 calories, which is not bad at all, especially considering nutritional payload is a respectable 3g of fat (none of which is saturated, so it's \"good\" fat), and no cholesterol. More impressive is only 45mg of sodium and a mere 2g of sugar. Comparatively speaking, these are a pretty smart choice for a snack if you're worried about those kinds of things.<br /><br />I was really happy to see the ingredients list was relatively short and contained no hydrogenated fats (sources of trans fatty acids), high fructose corn syrup (they use cane syrup, which is preferable to me), or MSG. Rice flour, dry sweet potatoes, and tapioca are the biggest ingredients. As far as processed foods go, not bad at all.<br /><br />I will definitely buy these again.",

However it's not the most money wise way to buy the k-cups, so I thought when I saw these on sale I thought I would give them a shot. I have to say I'm absolutely infatuated with Jet Fuel. I definitely like my coffee strong, as a previous Starbucks Barista, and the undertones of chocolate are wonderful for my sweet tooth. I highly recommend these for anyone who likes bold coffee, people who prefer something like a breakfast blend would probably find Jet Fuel to be too bitter. I also like that there's no excess packaging. I ordered the same size box of breakfast blend for my mother and I swear I could have fit in the box it came in!",

    "review_text": "My wife and I purchased Timothy's World Coffee, Parisian Nights, Extra Bold K-Cups for over two years and used Amazon's subscription to automatic shipping for the best economy.  It was disappointing to learn a few weeks ago that this particular coffee would no longer be available on the subscription program.  We looked over the list of coffees that would be available and selected Coffee People Jet Fuel K-Cups because the label and description included \"Dark Extra Bold.\"  We are very satisfied with the new coffee.  It has the strong, rich flavor and aroma we like.  It is difficult to distinguish this Jet Fuel coffee from our old favorite Parisian Nights.  All of the subscription coffees are in boxes of 50 K-Cups which is a little more economical than the former 24 K-Cup boxes.  This savings plus the discount for subscribing to automatic free shipping results in the lowest cost we have found for these K-Cups.",

Espresso is fine with me, and when I make my own coffee I make it as strong as can be.  If all I have is instant I  at least quadruple the amount of coffee to water.  In other words, I like a strong coffee, and Jet Fuel by my standards is strong in flavor only.  Okay strong isn't the best word; HARSH would be a better word.  It's not a pleasurable drinking experience.<br /><br />I took some to work to let a coworker try it, and I think he nailed the aroma and flavor of this Jet Fuel coffee.  He said it's like a dirty ashtray.  After he said that it clicked in my mind.  Dang, yes that is what it tastes like.  Now, I will give the benefit of the doubt that I got a bad batch, but so far since I was a sucker and bought 50 of them, I keep drinking them usually adding instant coffee, or another nicer flavored coffee to it to kill the ashtray flavor because all of them taste the same so far.<br /><br />Be warned, I'm no stranger to harsh coffee, but this IMHO is not a pleasant harsh.<br /><br />J",

After a week of drinking this coffee however, maybe I have a different definition of strong coffee.  Every day I drink this very average coffee on the way to work and say to myself, write a review so others don't do what I did, and buy 50 cups of the stuff.<br /><br />It has a bitter taste with not a lot of anything else going on, and maybe that is what some people consider strong.  Maxwell House crowd perhaps.  I prefer coffee with more depth and complexity, i.e. Starbucks, and Jet Fuel misses that mark by a wide margin.<br /><br />My favorite K Cups so far have been Donut Shop, Kona, and Caribou Blend.  Caribou is a great choice if you like bold and rich coffee, but now I am stuck with 50 cups of Jet Fuel.  Don't believe the hype.",

I'm not sure what Amazon's reasoning is for the huge and sudden price hike.  I read that they claimed it's an increased price from the manufacturer, but all other retailers that I count on for K Cups have kept the same price, so that seems like an excuse.  At $27 a 50-ct. case, I can walk into any number of retailers with a basic sale or easily accessible coupon and get a MUCH better deal.  Sorry Amazon!

    "review_text": "My girlfriend and I got a Keurig a couple years ago. Previously, donut shop or caribou kcups were our favorite. Those are both great, we still love them. I ordered the sfbay french roast, as was definitely intrigued. It had a bold taste, and the cups themselves got my attention. I wish the top cap wasn't plastic, but the pouch definitely allows for more of that coffee smell that I missed when moving to the keurig. I decided to try fog chaser out, it's fantastic. The flavor is wonderful, smells great while you're brewing, and we cut the tops off and easily compost the rest. It's a step in the right direction, and I would recommend these to anyone with a keurig.",

It is incredibly good, I don't think I want a cup of coffee and then I remember these are in the carousel for my Keurig machine, I change my mind in a heartbeat. It's like having a box of your favorite snack in the cupboard and trying to resist eating it, but you know it's there and you keep thinking about it.<br /><br />The flavor of this San Fransisco Bay coffee is rich, complex, and delicious. I can't think of a cup of coffee that I've bought anywhere that can beat the bold, rich flavor of this brand. It's like drinking a glass of fine wine. My favorite k-cup previous to this was Tulley's Kona Blend.<br /><br />The packaging of the individual coffee pod threw me off because when I opened the plastic bag with the pods in it, a very strong aroma of coffee filled the air. I wondered if the paper filter bottoms of the pods wouldn't let the coffee get stale, so I put them in a ziplock baggie. Time will tell I guess if the paper filter will allow the coffee to get stale or not. On the other hand I liked that there was a more green solution to the regular plastic coffee pod holder. I'm torn on this, I 'think' I'd rather have the pods be the more usual plastic in order to preserve freshness, but time will tell. I doubt any of the pods I have will have time to ever get stale however, because I'm drinking them all the time.",

    "review_text": "SF Bay Coffee's Fog Chaser was a nice \"bold\" surprise.  I am a big fan of Amazon's Subscribe & Save program and have been getting my K-cups this way for over a year.  Of course, once you find one you absolutely love (Timothy's World Midnight Magic), poof!  The Magic's gone!  Midnight Magic is still available on Amazon, though no longer offered through Subscribe & Save, and I refuse to pay $35 for 48 K-cups of any brand.  S & S now offers SF Bay Coffee's Fog Chaser and based on the quantity of favorable reviews, I decided to give it a shot.  The pods are far different than what we've all been used to, but they work like a charm, have less waste, and deliver a pretty bold, smooth cup of coffee.  My morning coffee always consists of two pods at the 6 oz. setting each for one eye-opening 12 oz. mug of coffee.  On that setting, Fog Chaser lives up to its name.  I have noticed some residue occasionally, but it certainly is minimal.  The pods come packed in plastic bags (12 pods/bag).  Once cut open, I just fold over the edge, clip it and store the bag in the fridge.  Strength is a personal decision, and to me, more than 6 oz. of water with ANY pod is too weak.  If you are a fan of Rev of Jet Fuel, this coffee is comparable.",

After I try the other flavors, I will use the subsription plan.<br /><br />After meeting my husband, I started drinking darker roast coffees, and this Fog Chaser was bold and delicious.  But the biggest reason why I tried this brand was because of the lack of the extra plastic.  I've felt bad about the excess plastic that was being discarded with K-cups.  I've bought a wide variety of gadgets that are compatible with Keurig, all in attempts to reduce waste.  Some had a re-usable cup with small inner paper filter, (which I still use when I acquire my own ground coffee) others were caps that went over re-used K-cups after they were emptied and rinsed.  But that all takes time that I don't always have.  I feel better that these have less waste PLUS they're less expensive than regular K-cups.  A subscription will make it that much cheaper.<br /><br />The box has separate bags of 8 coffee pods each.  I don't think maintaining freshness is an issue for me, since once I open up a bag, I simply put them in a sealed plastic container.  There is one plastic container included in the box, but it's a little on the flimsy side, certainly not Tupperware tough, but it's still enough to store these.  I drink one to two cups a day, so the opened bag doesn't have a chance to sit around long anyways.<br /><br />This fit perfectly in my Keurig machine, too.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this to others.",

I was not disappointed as this is a strong, but not too strong, good-tasting coffee that not only tastes great but has a nice aroma.<br /><br />The pods are a little different than your traditional plastic K-cup portion as, instead of any plastic around the sides or bottom you have basically a mesh coffee filter holding the coffee grounds.  This appears to make a more complete brew, and allows more of the flavor to come into the actual coffee.  You will see a dirty residue at the bottom of your cup due to this filtration system vs. a \"clean\" look from a normal K-cup pod.  This seems to make sense as the normal K-cup pod has all of the brewed coffee escaping through the pinprick hole vs. the full brewing experience of these pods.<br /><br />As the pods are in this filtration medium the coffee is not air-tight sealed after you open the package of pods.  I have put the unused ones in a sealed Ziploc bag to keep them fresh.<br /><br />I also shared this with some folks in the office, who liked it so much they ordered their own so it's not just me who likes this stuff.  Who knows, I may have found a new favorite coffee!",

    "review_title": "finally coffee for my picky palate!",
    "review_text": "Recently I have become more and more choosy with my coffee. I own a Keurig one-cup brewer as well as a traditional coffee maker.<br />For years, I have been using the same coffee brand ( med or dark, middle-of-the road priced) and it was affordable and it tasted just fine. Lately, I was lacking depth and body when brewing in the keurig( I have the cup you can put your own coffee in, which saves resources and $). It seemed like I couldnt' pack enough flavor into the little chamber to really have the right strength. The pre-packed, ready to use K cups were much better, but at 3 cups/day for me not feasible in the long run.<br />I read the reviews of the San Francisco Bay coffee ( fog chaser) and the price appealed to me and also what customers had described, so I tried it. Besides the much more affordable price and far more \"green\" packaging, I find the flavor fantastic!<br />Bold, yet sophisticated, not just strong- really pleasant flavor ! A very good choice at an attractive price!. These cups look different, but I like them much better with their filter-like body and 12-count bagging. Now I don't feel guilty when I indulge with more than 1 K cup. For loose coffee to put into the reusable cup I choose a def. dark roast like italian or french, which is very comparable to the Fog chaser's aroma.",

If you like good coffee, this is worth a try.<br /><br />****EDIT****<br /><br />I thought about writing a long rant, about how the negative reviewers of this coffee, don't know what good coffee taste like, but I thought twice.  They just like a different taste to their coffee.  So instead, if you like Folgers, Maxwell House, Green Mountain, The Coffee People, etc., you will probably not like this coffee.  The people who will like this, should know who they are, by my previous comment.  I did find a couple of varieties of coffee from the same manufacture I did somewhat enjoy; Coffee People - Black Tiger, Green Mountain - Black Magic and Sumatran Reserve, although I did not like it enough, to purchase them again.<br /><br />Here is a list of coffee I really enjoy and come in K-Cups.<br />Caribou Mahogany, Starbucks Sumatra and Pikes Place.",

When I saw Amazon had Fog Chaser for the Keurig I was thrilled. The flavor is full bodied and rich with a very smooth finish.<br /><br />Because I was familiar with Fog Chaser, I never even looked at the reviews before I made my purchase.  Therefore, I was rather surprised when I opened the box and saw the different type of pod.  With a filter bottom the pod seems much more environmentally friendly.  There was no residue at the bottom of my mug so the filter did a good job.  I agree with other reviewers of the need to keep these pods in a vacuum sealed container (or zip lock bag) but I think the use of less platics is a good thing.<br /><br />I have a B60 and these fit perfectly in the machine. I used the large cup setting and the strength of the coffee was perfect for my taste (I prefer stronger coffee).  Before purchasing Fog Chaser I was buying Jet Fuel.",

I'll use up the ocffee and then try something even milder as this is too strong for my taste buds.",

    "review_text": "Don't be alarmed when you receive these and they don't look like a standard K-cup. These are not K-cups, but dowill fit in your machine. I thought I had ordered the wrong product at first. These simply have a plastic ring at the top so that they'll fit in your K-cup holder and the rest of it is like a standard coffee filter. I've only tried Fog Chaser (ordered all 3 flavors) and was surprised that I liked the coffee. However, because it's using a filter rather than the K-cup technology, it does leave a sediment in the bottom of your cup. I find this also happens when using the My K-Cup filter with whatever brand of coffee I use.<br /><br />You will need to store the \"k-cups\" in a ziploc to keep them fresh. The 36-count come packaged in 3 plastic bags of 12 each. This is nice so that you only have to open up one 12 pack at a time so the others can stay fresh.<br /><br />I'm mostly neutral, but lean more toward \"would buy again\".",

    "review_text": "I had to try this coffee in an attempt to find a lower price on k-cups. I love it! It's a good strong brew, with a nice smoky aroma. The 36-count comes as 3 plastic bags of 12 cups. After opening the 1st bag, I'm keeping the remainder in the bag, sealed with a clip. It's possible that these could have freshness issues if left out for several days/weeks. I don't think my supply will last long enough to go bad though. I like the idea of less plastic - I like to compost my coffee grounds in the summer and these have much easier access to dumping out the grounds. (I can just tear open the mesh bag.) They fit in the Keurig and brew just fine.<br /><br />In fact, I usually buy the strongest coffee k-cups so I can \"double-brew\" mine into a bigger mug. True coffee aficionados may not prefer this. It may be too strong if you like lighter roasts or flavored coffees.<br /><br />Tastes great, cheaper and more environmentally friendly than other k-cups!",

    "review_text": "This is a first impressions review of the unique cup SF Bay uses in place of the traditional sealed K-cup design after using 12 cups.<br /><br />The cups work fine. They may take a few more seconds to brew (I haven't timed it) because the filter bag inflates with the hot water before the coffee comes out. This makes me think that the mesh bag is actually sealed somehow and that seal is broken with the pressure of the hot water as it's injected into the cup. A strong smell test indicates that there is some sort of seal there because there is not a strong coffee smell coming from the dry cups.<br /><br />If there is some sort of seal these cups should stay fresh longer than they would if the coffee was completely exposed to air. I am still storing these cups in the sealed 12 pack bags they came in and would recommend storing them in a sealed container if you don't go through them quickly. The need to store them sealed takes some convenience out of the K-cup system but the lower price of these cups should offset that.<br /><br />As for the coffee itself, it was good, strong, and tasted more like a fresh cup of coffee than any other k-cups I've tried. It could be the coffee or could be the cup itself. I plan to order a few different flavors in this cup style to find out.",

And I'm not one bit sorry I did, I feel a tad guilty for semi-abandoning my Green Mountain! This Fogchaser blend  makes a good strong  cup of coffee without giving me the  feeling that the lining of my stomach is going to burn out.<br /><br />I'm thrilled to see that I now have an alternative to Green Mountain and I can even save money since it is at least 3 dollars cheaper (at least in my grocery store) a package.",

After all, given the wide disparity of opinion about which k-cup blend is bold, strong or rich in flavor, at least finding common ground with others who enjoy the aforementioned brands you can estimate the appeal of the flavor to your own palate.<br /><br />At the time I placed my order I didn't find any clear indicators from other reviewers along these lines, hence for what it's worth, as one who enjoys the previously mentioned k-cups, I can say that overall San Francisco Bay French Roast measures up pretty darn well to the more expensive brands.<br /><br />Now if cost were not a factor I'm not certain this would be my first choice as this blend has a somewhat smoky after taste and I prefer a more fruity or sweet flavor.

    "review_text": "My wife and I purchased Timothy's World Coffee, Parisian Nights, Extra Bold K-Cups for over two years and used Amazon's subscription to automatic shipping for the best economy.  It was disappointing to learn a few weeks ago that this particular coffee would no longer be available on the subscription program.  We looked over the list of coffees that would be available and selected Coffee People Jet Fuel K-Cups because the label and description included \"Dark Extra Bold.\"  We are very satisfied with the new coffee.  It has the strong, rich flavor and aroma we like.  It is difficult to distinguish this Jet Fuel coffee from our old favorite Parisian Nights.  All of the subscription coffees are in boxes of 50 K-Cups which is a little more economical than the former 24 K-Cup boxes.  This savings plus the discount for subscribing to automatic free shipping results in the lowest cost we have found for these K-Cups.",

Really...they're kcups, not bone china, why the need for 2 packages, carboard, plastic and another box?<br /><br />I like the fact that these kcups come in a single box, not as much waste.<br /><br />Anyway, my picky husband said that this coffee was surprisingly good.

    "review_text": "I went out on a limb and purchased this 50 pack of Jet Fuel because of so many good reviews.  Let me start by saying, I like STRONG coffee.  Espresso is fine with me, and when I make my own coffee I make it as strong as can be.  If all I have is instant I  at least quadruple the amount of coffee to water.  In other words, I like a strong coffee, and Jet Fuel by my standards is strong in flavor only.  Okay strong isn't the best word; HARSH would be a better word.  It's not a pleasurable drinking experience.<br /><br />I took some to work to let a coworker try it, and I think he nailed the aroma and flavor of this Jet Fuel coffee.  He said it's like a dirty ashtray.  After he said that it clicked in my mind.  Dang, yes that is what it tastes like.  Now, I will give the benefit of the doubt that I got a bad batch, but so far since I was a sucker and bought 50 of them, I keep drinking them usually adding instant coffee, or another nicer flavored coffee to it to kill the ashtray flavor because all of them taste the same so far.<br /><br />Be warned, I'm no stranger to harsh coffee, but this IMHO is not a pleasant harsh.<br /><br />J",

Even the largest size on the Kurig is OK.  Anyway, the Jet fuel is quite similar and I can't tell much of a difference.  They are both strong enough for my taste.  One problem I did have, is the cardboard box was so large it would not fit in the kitchen cabinet.  It is one of the \"frustration-free\" Amazon boxes.",

May put away our Keurig brewer and haul out the ol' drip maker from the back of the cabinet.  The taste of the coffee rates five stars.  If factoring in the price, it would be fewer stars.",

    "review_text": "As a self-confessed coffee addict for the past 20 years, I'd like to think that I'm a good judge of coffee.  Yes, if you poke through my previous reviews, you'll see that I rated a bag of Yuban (Breakfast Blend) rather highly.  So you may be surprised at my middling review of a bag of Starbucks and might therefore brand me a \"hater\". I am not. I love their Sumatran, Komodo Dragon, Anniversary Blend and their Christmas Blend.  AND, I was really looking forward a \"subtle flavor\" of vanilla in a cup of coffee. Now that we're all clear:<br /><br />Opening the bag of Starbucks Natural Infusions Vanilla, you'll immediately be hit by the scent of vanilla.  I was a bit scared that the coffee would wind up overpoweringly vanilla once brewed, but it wasn't so.  The vanilla is pronounced, but not overpowering once brewed.  HOWEVER, once brewed, the coffee beans' origin is immediately obvious.  The bag says \"Latin American beans\" but what they mean is Colombian. There's no mistaking that distinctive scent or taste.  Also, this is not a dark roast, not a bold coffee; it's a tame pseudo-breakfast roast.  It is a bit oily, but not overly so. (As another reviewer noted, this may be due to the added glycerin.)<br /><br />Point of interest: I drip brewed 6 cups for my initial tasting and did not add anything nor doctor the brew.  And onto the taste: very Colombian coffee, definitely vanilla, mildly sweet.  Starbucks not only added vanilla to the ground coffee, but they also added sarsparilla root and \"natural flavor\" including corn maltodextrin.  This is likely why it comes off as sweet when served black.<br /><br />The vanilla flavor is there, make no mistake.  And the sweetness is there too.  No, this isn't as pronounced as adding a shot of flavored syrup to your coffee, but it isn't as subtle as the packaging would have us believe. If you like flavored coffee, this is right up your alley.  But, a note to coffee drinkers who like their coffee strong and bitter: this is not the coffee for you!<br /><br />I don't hate this coffee, but I don't love it.  If someone served it to me, I'd drink it (black) and not complain... until I got home.  ;-)",

However, in the case of this coffee I found the vanilla flavor to be rather subtle.<br /><br />This coffee is not a dark and/or strong blend; it is rather mild so the discreet hints of vanilla give this beverage a smooth taste.  I used flavored creamer when I drank this coffee. My first cup I used hazelnut and my second cup I used pumpkin spice.  I found the hints of vanilla gleamed out rather nice with both of these flavor creams.  I haven't used it with basic cream, but I am sure the taste would still be pleasant.

It was so similar I got my little container of vanilla extract out of the cupboard and compared the two. This ground coffee definitely has natural flavoring. Unfortunately, I think it's a little too natural and too strong for my preferences.<br /><br />You know when you bake and a recipe calls for maybe a teaspoon of vanilla extract? That's because it's strong stuff! I'm convinced that the same approach wasn't taken when creating this coffee--no \"less is more\" approach when it comes to Starbucks using natural fusions, I suppose.<br /><br />Once I got past the smell, because I was still determined to taste it, I was pleasantly surprised. The taste is a lot more subtle than the scent. It still takes like coffee, not something spiced up like chai or other unnaturally flavored coffees. It has subtle spicy taste to it along with the natural vanilla. I attribute this to the sarsaparilla root. It made for an alright cup of coffee. It would be better if I couldn't smell it.<br /><br />I finished my mug, but I think I'll be passing the rest of the pack on to someone else who wants to try it and stick with my Starbucks House Blend or Breakfast Blend.<br /><br />FYI, Ingredients: ground coffee, natural flavor (with corn maltodextrin, vegetable glycerin), ground vanilla beans, Indian sarsaparilla root",

One person called the aftertaste \"chemically,\" despite Starbucks' assertion of all natural flavorings.<br /><br />The next day, we brewed a third batch in our preferred coffee maker, a french press. The vanilla flavor was more pronounced, but so was the bitterness. None of us finished our individual cups of the french press brewed batch. In Starbucks defense, using a press ignores their directions which specifically say to use a \"machine,\" so we did not weigh this batch heavily in our rating.<br /><br />Overall, we agreed that it is drinkable, but not worth the premium price.

It has a full, rich flavor, which is surprising considering that it is definitely less aromatic than similar vanilla products. In fact, one has to lean in close even to a just opened bag to get a whiff of the vanilla (which for those of us who enjoy the smell of coffee, and particularly flavored coffee, is a disappointment). However, once brewed, the vanilla flavoring comes across in just the right amount. On the second brewing, we (my husband and I) did decide to make it a bit stronger just for personal tastes, but this coffee is smooth and full even without the extra boost. Definitely a coffee we'd both recommend to lovers of flavored coffees!",

This is a fairly smooth, mellow cup of coffee, if you're careful to use the right amount in the brewing.  However, I always find that Starbucks coffees have a sort of burnt edge to the flavor, as if the beans were over-roasted, and this one is no exception.  I also have a commitment to purchasing fair trade, sustainably grown, bird-friendly coffee, and Starbucks does not qualify on any of those counts.  I'm not downgrading the coffee for this -- the 3-star rating is based just on the flavor -- but since Starbucks does not meet these expectations, it's not a brand I will choose in the future for a regular coffee.",

I wasn't used to the vanilla taste.  And there IS a vanilla taste.  And smell.  It's a really pleasant, delicious vanilla, actually.  Once I got used to it, I really like the addition of the vanilla to my concoction.  That bag was quickly used up, and I went back to the half-used regular coffee bag.  I quickly decided to buy another bag of the vanilla natural fusions next time coffee was on my shopping list. :]<br /><br />And yeah, it is nice that you can bring in the empty bag for a tall brewed coffee at any Starbucks.",

    "review_text": "I've always wanted to try some of the Starbucks coffee. Since we don't have a Starbucks in the little town that I live in and what they have in the grocery store is so expensive I haven't had a chance to till now. So when it was on my Vine List to try out I jumped on it.<br />  Most of the other vanilla flavored coffee's that I've tried have had a very strong vanilla flavor to them. So I usually have to cut it 2 to 1 or ½ & ½ with some Folgers to get the level of Vanilla flavor that I like.  But this Starbucks Vanilla Coffee doesn't seem to have very much Vanilla flavor to it at all. I made the first pot of it like I usually do with the flavored coffee's and mixed it 2 to 1, 2 parts Starbucks to 1 part Folgers. I could hardly taste the Vanilla at all in that pot so the next one I made with just the Starbucks coffee. This time it had a slight and very light Vanilla flavor. It was still a very good pot of coffee but it didn't have much of a Vanilla flavor to it.<br />  So if your looking for a flavored coffee with a lot of Vanilla to it then you will be disappointed. But if your looking for one with a slight and very lite Vanilla flavor in it then you will love this one. If you have never tried a flavored coffee I would definitely suggest trying this. It has just enough Vanilla to it to say that it does and it's a great tasting coffee.",

I brewed it according to package directions, measuring everything exactly. I figured I could adjust and go from there. The coffee itself is deep, dark, and very robust - just the way I like it. I simply cannot stand what many people like, the common watered-down breakfast or house blends - yuk. I do like an occasional flavored coffee if done right. This time, however, Starbucks simply ruined the concept with that hideous alcohol after bite. If I brew with less coffee, I lose the delicious robustness of the star - the coffee. I wish I knew which bean blend they used as a base. I would buy that on it's own. I won't be purchasing this vanilla fusion any time soon. I may try the cinnamon one next.",

They have twice the caffeine as most other brands, they really roast their beans (some may say burn?), so I would expect their foray into flavored coffees to overwhelm as well.  Except, that's not happening.  The ingredients are tame, coffee, vanilla, and sarsaparilla -- that's it!  The flavor is nice and the flavor of vanilla is subtle, not overpowering.<br /><br />The aroma, on the other hand, is quite strong.  I brought the empty bag in here to refer to while I write this review and the office now smells like vanilla.  Vanilla aroma also wanders throughout the house as each new pot of coffee is brewed. It's a pleasant scent, though.  I'll take it over the stench of air fresheners any day.<br /><br />Would I pay twice the price for this versus a competing brand?  No, but I'd pay a little more.",

    "review_text": "Since I drink my coffee black without any creamer or sweeteners, the taste of the coffee itself really matters to me.  This vanilla-flavored coffee comes ground, which saves me the step of grinding the beans myself.  Even though the beans are pre-ground, the flavor after brewing was still deep and rich, and the aromatic fragrance of vanilla still permeated after I opened the vacuum sealed bag.<br /><br />The flavoring of the vanilla in this coffee is subtle and mild.  I mention this because with some flavored coffees, a particular flavor can be quite distinct and strong, and dominate the taste of the coffee.  For me personally, that can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the particular flavor; I like pumpkin spice strongly flavored, while I prefer cinnamon and vanilla to be more subtle.  So, if you are looking for heavily flavored vanilla coffee, expect something a bit more subtle with this flavor.<br /><br />At 11 ounces, this is not a terribly large quantity of coffee for the money.  That said, however, Starbucks has never been the bargain hunter's choice for economical coffee, and this is reasonably priced in relation to other speciality coffees.",

I'm not certain why, but vanilla in Coffeemate tastes fine to me, but the vanilla 'infusion' into this coffee simply tasted too artificial for my palate, even when adding a non-flavored creamer.

It's very smooth - it doesn't have a harsh 'bite' to it at all, the vanilla flavor in it tastes very 'real' and not some horrid chemical rendition of vanilla and again, didn't leave a bad aftertaste.  I served it to family who visited who are AVID coffee drinkers and they enjoyed it as well - actually asked me what brand it was.<br /><br />For those of you who enjoy your flavored coffees, Vanilla is a GREAT flavor to have on hand since you can do so many things to it in my opinion.  I added some cocoa powder to the grounds one time to make a vanilla - chocolate coffee (YUM!), another time I added cinnamon (DOUBLE YUM!) and another time, Pumpkin Pie spices (hubby didn't like this but I did).

Starbucks seems to have found a good balance between vanilla and coffee flavors.  The vanilla is not overpowering, but you know it is there.  The components of vanilla come from ground vanilla beans and Indian sarsaparilla root.<br /><br />I was a little taken aback by two of the items on the ingredient list.  Corn Maltodextrin?

What follows is pleasantly full, smooth and balanced, without the chemical aftertaste ubiquitous among cheaper brands of flavored coffees.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO\">Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored</a> can be comfortably served in your home kitchen or at the office boardroom. The subtlety of the vanilla aroma will be a pleasant surprise for anyone asking for a cup of coffee. This is not a flavored coffee for people who drink coffee through a straw.<br /><br />We prepared our coffee using our <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005YY9X\">Bodum Columbia 8-Cup Stainless-Steel Thermal Press Pot</a> and refreshed our travel cup from a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009V4FM\">Thermos Nissan 34-Ounce Stainless-Steel Vacuum Insulated Briefcase Bottle</a>.

    "review_text": "The nice thing about vanilla is that it is subtle.  Unlike other flavors often used in coffees (cinnamon, fall spices, etc.) vanilla is not meant to be a strong flavor.  It is truly their to compliment the coffee.  The vanilla flavor is very natural and takes the edge off the coffee.  The smoothness of the coffee does not overpower the vanilla, and the flavors do not seem to be competing for space on your palette.  I would recommend this coffee as an enjoyable break from your everyday blend.",

For both those reasons, I was pleasantly surprised with this pack of Starbucks Vanilla, which balances the flavor with a mellow, smooth brew. Made in a French press, it's the perfect afternoon shot-in-the-arm, and the vanilla really isn't as over-powering as I expected. From a pricing standpoint, it's well priced for two bags, and I can definitely see myself stocking up for holidays, which seem to be the perfect time of year for flavored coffee.",

I've reviewed some other brands that were actually better.  I am very particular about vanilla.  Artificial vanilla is an abomination.  Genuine vanilla, just like coffee has a pretty wide range of flavors and quality levels.  This one may be natural but its not quality.  I found the vanilla in this to be aromatic but a bit underwhelming as far as flavoring.  The coffee was good but just a little bitter when consumed black.  Sugar and cream smooth it out but that pretty much defeats the point of getting a preflavored coffee as far as I'm concerned.",

    "review_text": "I figured I would give this 11-ounce package of \"Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored\" a chance to prove my bias against flavored coffees was groundless. The smell of the flavoring--be it real vanilla, imitation vanilla, or something that isn't vanilla at all but smells like someone's idea of vanilla--escapes even from the sealed bag to the point I decided not to keep this coffee near the rest of my stash. After opening the bag, I involuntarily snapped my head away, fearing my olfactory system might be under siege by the sickly sweet smell.<br /><br />Next was to try this coffee, and I admit my courage faltered when I considered what an unadulterated cup of this vanilla flavored coffee might taste like in the morning as I prepared the coffee and set the timer. So I mixed in a good dose of regular coffee, probably three-fifths regular, two-fifths vanilla flavored.<br /><br />Well, first impression is that using the word \"natural\" to describe this flavor would be a reach until I remembered that just because something does not have an appealing smell does not mean it is not natural and that perhaps these vanilla bean received the same treatment as civet coffee. The coffee seems to burn slightly as it goes down, and tastes overly sweet even without any extra sweetener. I needed that second cup at 6:15 a.m. far more than I wanted it, and I will not be drinking this brew again except as iced coffee and even then, not without cutting it with some regular coffee to help constrain the cloying flavor that coats the back-of-the-throat like the taste of some awful medicine.",

If you are used to drinking flavored coffees, you won't taste much vanilla...just a hint.  Very smooth and overall good taste.<br /><br />The ingredients on the side of the package says:  Ground coffee, natural flavor (with corn maltodextrin, vegetable glycerin), ground vanilla beans, Indian sarsaparilla root.  Also on the bag it says, \"To preserve that fresh just roasted flavor, keep this bag sealed tight in a cabinet (not the refrigerator) and brew within a week of opening.\"<br /><br />Overall I liked it.

The vanilla flavor is really subtle. I could do with a little more vanilla, and I can see why people are dissatisfied with the slightness of the flavor. What little bit is present, though, is a really nice vanilla taste and not the aftertastey yuck a lot of flavored coffees have.<br /><br />I think I'm going to have my flavored-coffee-hating roommate try this too. (Edited to add: Roomie liked it, commenting that it didn't have that fakey syrup taste; roomie didn't like the strong vanilla aroma as much as I did, though.)

That one was more like a regular cup of coffee, though, less strong and complex than the Starbucks variety described here, though the vanilla flavoring had about the same flavor and strength in both coffees.<br /><br />It's all a matter of personal taste.  Some people like a no-nonsense coffee like the Melitta and some like the gourmet richness of a Starbucks.  Myself, I go back and forth.

    "review_title": "Vanilla too strong",
    "review_text": "Normally, we love Starbucks' coffee, and so we were inclined to like this version of it. However, both me and my Significant Other found the vanilla flavor too strong. For some reason, this is not a pleasant vanilla flavor; I want to say that the aftertaste is a bit on the medicinal side. I wouldn't say the unpleasantness had anything to do with the vanilla flavor being sweet - it wasn't, although to me, not being sweet was a good idea. An added flavor, especially in a coffee labeled \"natural fusions\", ~should~ be just a taste and not mixed up with sugars or syrup.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this flavor didn't work for two people. The coffee was otherwise full-bodied, but I can't say it was smooth because of the vanilla attack in the flavoring.",

    "review_title": "Not much bang for your buck",
    "review_text": "As stated on the packaging, this vanilla flavored coffee by Starbucks has a \"subtle flavor and an indulgent aroma\".  So much so, in fact, that brewing the coffee is a more satisfying experience than drinking it.<br /><br />Going off of the recommended 2 Tbsp of coffee for every 6 oz. of water, I found the brew diluted and weak-willed.  Stepping up the dosage does deliver a more powerful vanilla taste, but you'll find yourself plowing through the 11 oz. bag at a much quicker rate.<br /><br />All told, if a light, mild vanilla brew is what you're after, this offering by Starbucks will suit you.  If, however, you're after a more potent brew, you would likely get more bang for your buck with a less \"subtle flavor.\"",

    "review_title": "Smooth, Silky, Good Aroma",
    "review_text": "I'm a coffee addict, so I normally tend to go for bold dark roast coffees, but the Starbucks French Vanilla Coffee was good. It has a very smooth, silky texture and a good aroma. It has a slightly vanilla taste, and it is delicious with milk and sugar to bring out the vanilla flavor. Highly recommend for anyone who likes to \"dress up\" their coffee to make it sweet.",

    "review_title": "Very good flavor.",
    "review_text": "As an addicted coffee drinker, I love trying out new flavors.  I have, of course, drank Starbucks coffee before, as well as Vanilla flavored coffees.  However, I have not had the two combined together into one coffee.  I can honestly say that I was not disappointed with Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored.  The package is incredibly well sealed and upon opening, the scent is mouth-watering and fresh.<br /><br />The amount used is the same as with any other coffee - 2 TBS per 6 oz of water.  This, of course, can be adjusted for each individual's preference.  The scent is heavenly, as the coffee is brewing and the taste is very robust and holds a light flavor of vanilla.  The vanilla flavoring is a very gentle and light taste, almost a whisper soft hint.  In addition, the taste is not bitter, but smooth and delicious.  I am one who drinks with a bit of sugar and cream, rather than straight black, as well as being rather picky on my coffee, as it bothers my stomach if it is overly acidic.  I had not problems, at all, with this particular coffee.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a full-bodied coffee with a slight hint of a vanilla taste.  This makes for a delicious drink any time of the day.",
